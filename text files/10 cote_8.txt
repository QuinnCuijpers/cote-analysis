Chapter 1:
Horikita Manabu’s Soliloquy
 
THERE ARE THINGS people would be surprised to discover—for
example, that I didn’t choose to attend this school to satisfy any burning
ambitions. I’d always tried to excel, but in an aimless sort of way. I didn’t
know what I truly wanted out of life. I didn’t aspire to be a politician, a
doctor, a researcher, or anything else.
For better or worse, I liked to avoid drama. I spent my days working,
indifferent and detached, merely focused upon completing the tasks assigned
to me.
Setting an “example.”
Being a “role model.”
I believed that this was the right thing to do. However, Nagumo Miyabi
continues to take direct action against me, trying to clear me from his path.
Perhaps ‘a bulldozer’ is the description that fits him best.
As a matter of fact, I’d given up on taking action against him by the
time graduation neared. I’d also never actually tried to make a friend whom I
could truly trust from the bottom of my heart. Such things were still foreign
to me.
At the end of those three years, though, it finally hit me. I realized my
mistake—and the regret that it had left me with.
And, I realized, that this was just the beginning.

Chapter 2:
A New Special Exam:
Mixed Training Camp
 
ON A THURSDAY MORNING, shortly after the start of the third semester,
several buses traveled in a row down the highway. The buses carried not only
first-year students, but second- and third-year as well—the entire school
jointly embarking on one big road trip.
The bus that carried us—the first-year Class C students—entered a
tunnel. My ears were assaulted by the pressure change.
This was the second time I’d ridden a bus since enrolling at this school.
No one had explained where we were headed or what we were doing. All we
knew was that we had to wear jerseys, and it was strongly recommended we
pack several spare jerseys and changes of underwear before we left. This
didn’t sound like a vacation, though.
Since the bus ride was about three hours or so, everyone had brought
along fun items considered acceptable by the school. Cell phones were a
given, but people had also brought books, playing cards, and snacks and
juice. Some had even brought along game consoles.
Our seats were designated, with our names written on them, and I was
seated next to Ike Kanji. I’d intended to get along with him when I enrolled
here, but our relationship was still at the “just fellow classmates” stage, and
opportunities to hang out with him had decreased dramatically. Instead of
talking to me, his literal seatmate, he knelt on his seat, turned around, and had
a loud conversation with Sudou and Yamauchi, who were seated further
away.
I occasionally heard the girls tell them off for being annoying, but they
didn’t pay much mind. It was uproarious in here, anyway, so it was no
wonder that they weren’t holding back. I felt a bit lonely, but there was
nothing I could do about it.
On the bright side…the recent round of exams had let me grow closer
to students like Akito and Keisei.
2

The atmosphere on the bus was pleasant, but I could tell this wouldn’t
be a mere field trip. If we’d done this in the middle of winter vacation, I
might have held out hope of it being just a fun outing, but the third semester
was already underway. It would probably be for us to anticipate an exam like
the one we’d had on the deserted island, just so we could prepare ourselves
mentally. It wasn’t as though Ike and the others hadn’t matured at all since
then. Probably.
Chabashira observed the students doing as they pleased with a look of
deep interest. She stood close to the driver, rather near my seat, as she stared
at us. Since I didn’t want our gazes to meet, I decided to stare out the
window. This was a long tunnel. It’d been two or three minutes since we
entered.
Just as I thought that, it began to get brighter. We’d made it through.
Chabashira, who had been waiting for us to emerge from the tunnel,
started to move. At the same time, the pain in my ears increased.
“Sorry to interrupt your enthusiasm, but be quiet,” she said, addressing
the students through a hand-held microphone. “I thought you might like to
know where this bus is headed, and also what you’ll be doing once we
arrive.”
“Well, yeah, ’course we’re curious. We’re not going to another
deserted island, are we?” asked Ike.
Chabashira answered quickly. “I see that special exam is still seared
into your collective memory. Allow me to give you some peace of mind; we
don’t hold special exams on that grand a scale very often. Nor are we so cruel
as to put you through something like that when it’s no longer summer.
However, as you can already guess, there is a new special exam ahead.
Compared to the island, though, you’ll be in significantly better living
conditions.”
So she said—but I didn’t trust her. The island aside, every special
exam we’d faced so far had been insanely difficult from an average student’s
perspective. Hanging over our heads was the ultimate penalty of failing one
of these special exams: expulsion.
“Now, the special exam that you Class D students will—”
Chabashira paused. My classmates smiled with a touch of pride as,
3
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
immediately after, she bowed her head in apology.
“I’m sorry. You are Class C now. Allow me to give you newly
promoted students an overview of the special exam.”
Having been formally promoted to Class C in the third semester, our
class seemed to be trying its best to calmly face the upcoming exam.
Receiving an explanation of how that special exam worked on the bus meant
we could prepare countermeasures, or at least try to. We couldn’t just get up
and walk around while the bus was in motion, but the bus was small enough
that everyone could hear you if you spoke, and we could always use our
phones to correspond privately with specific people.
Ike and the other noisemakers shut up, listening to what Chabashira
had to say. Proof that they had matured, if only a little.
“We are taking you to a school camp in the mountains. We will arrive
in just under an hour. The less time I have to spend explaining, the more time
you’ll have to strategize,” said Chabashira.
An hour until the exam started, huh? In other words, if it took twenty
minutes to explain the rules, we’d have forty minutes left over to plan.
“Don’t students normally attend school camps and stuff in the
summer?” asked Ike, who used to be a boy scout. He knew quite a bit about
the mountain range we could currently see from our seats as we traveled
down the highway. It was covered in white snow, even now.
“Please be quiet and listen. Remember, this is the only time you have,”
Chabashira rebuked, but she sounded gentle, rather than angry. Ike scratched
his head sheepishly and apologized. A brief moment of laughter ensued.
School camp. I’d never heard of it, so I looked it up on my phone.
“Typically held in the summer months on days when the weather is
nice. Commonly held in locations where greenery is abundant, such as the
mountains. Group activities are conducted with the express purpose of
promoting the development of healthy bodies. Can also refer to an
educational facility.”
Just as Ike had said, it sounded like these school camps were usually
held in the summer. Clearly, however, they could also take place any time of
year.

“Normally, opportunities to connect with senior students are few and
far between, especially for those not involved in club activities. At this school
camp, you’ll participate in inter-class group activities for eight days and
seven nights, making this a step beyond the Sports Festival. The name we’ve
given this special exam is the ‘Mixed Camp.’ Since I’m sure a verbal
explanation won’t satisfy you, I’ll be distributing printed materials now,”
Chabashira continued.
She handed a stack of printouts to the students sitting in the front row,
who each took one and then passed the rest back. The syllabus consisted of
about twenty pages. Since she hadn’t specifically told us not to look, I began
to flip through it.
There were clear photographs of what I assumed to be the camp,
including the dormitories, public baths, cafeteria, and so on. It was actually
kind of exciting to look at these; I felt like I was paging through a travel
guide. The all-important words special exam, however, curbed our
enthusiasm.
Still, this was twenty pages of documentation on top of a verbal
explanation. We’d only received a brief verbal explanation for the Paper
Shuffle, which meant this exam was probably shaping up to be pretty
annoying.
After confirming that everyone had received the handouts, Chabashira
resumed speaking.
“Feel free to keep reading, but I’m going to explain the Mixed Camp
now. These materials will be re-collected before you get off the bus, so please
make sure you clearly understand the rules. Questions will be accepted at the
end, so pay attention. Do you understand?” asked Chabashira, looking at Ike
as she spoke.
Ike nodded.
“The main goal of the Mixed Camp is to foster your mental
development. In order to accomplish this, we’re going to start with the
fundamentals of participation in civilized society—ensuring you can build
stable relationships with people you don’t know very well. Each and every
one of you will learn these skills.”
So that was why they were making us do group activities with senior
5
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
students, huh?
As Chabashira had just said, students who were in clubs might have
already developed relationships with their juniors or seniors. Even so, those
interactions were mostly limited to the club activities themselves. As for
students who weren’t in any clubs, hardly any of us had interacted with
upperclassmen at all. You might think the school would want us to fraternize
voluntarily, without need for exams or club activities to serve as incentive. Of
course, it wasn’t that simple in reality.
So, how did they plan to get the upperclassmen involved in this?
Unless the need for direct contact was a high priority, most students would
probably keep their distance from one another, just like we had during the
Sports Festival. Well, we were headed into the mountains to a place
designated as a camp, so that might be easier said than done…
At any rate, if the rules for the special exam weren’t set in stone, it
should be easy to find loopholes. There was a marked difference in maturity,
both physically and mentally, between first- and second-year students. A year
is a significant period of time in the life of a teenager. I couldn’t say how
extreme the gulf would prove to be, but the reality of the situation was that
we wouldn’t be on a level playing field.
“Once we arrive at our destination, we will divide you by gender. Next,
we’ll hold a school-wide discussion with all grade levels and then further
divide you into six groups.”
“Divide men and women, then make six groups…” muttered Ike, as
though he were trying to memorize the information.
Chabashira continued, “The minimum and maximum numbers of
people in each group have already been decided. Take a good look at the
guidelines on page 5 of your handout.”
The students all looked at once.
 
Group numbers are calculated based on the total number of students,
then separated by grade and gender. For instance, if there are 60 or more
male students in the same grade level, the minimum number of participants in
a group is 8, and the upper limit 13. If the total is 70 or more, the limits are 9
and 14. If the total is 80 or more, the limits are 10 and 15. However, in the
6
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
event the number of students is under 60, please refer to a separate table.
 
Let’s assume the ratio of boys to girls in a class didn’t vary between
grade levels. If there were 40 students in one class, with a boys to girls ratio
of 1:1—20 boys and 20 girls—then that meant, basically, that there were a
total of 80 boys across the four classes of a single grade level. That would
mean between 10 and 15 people per group, with a total of six groups overall.
But the fact that the syllabus referenced the total number of students first
meant that these numbers would change depending on how many people had
been expelled across all grade levels.
“You’re probably already aware of this, but sorting you into six groups
divided by gender means that students from different classes will be mixed
together. For the duration of the test, your group members will be your allies.
You’ll be in the same boat, as it were.”
“Isn’t it kinda ridiculous to ask us to be in groups with people from
other classes? I mean, they’re our enemies,” muttered Ike loud enough so that
Chabashira could hear him.
He’d probably been unable to contain himself any longer. But his own
words must have jogged something in his brain, because he brightened.
“Yeah, that’s it! We don’t really have to do that, do we? We can divide
Class C into two groups. That’ll take care of it, right? Ayanokouji?” he
asked, lowering his voice.
It was certainly true that Class C could form two groups of ten.
However, Ike’s idea just wouldn’t work.
“A good idea, but things aren’t that simple. The rules forbid forming a
group with students from just one class. As long as groups abide by the
approved headcount, you are free to team up with any class you wish. But
each group must have a combination of students from at least two classes.
More importantly, these groups aren’t selected through discussion. They must
be agreed upon unanimously,” said Chabashira.
What she’d just said was written plainly in the syllabus. “Every group
must consist of students from at least two or more classes.”
“So this means we have to make friends with the enemy?” Ike blurted
7
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
out. It was less of a question and more of something that had just slipped out.
“Yes, exactly,” replied Chabashira, looking slightly exasperated. “Of
course, you could form a group that consists almost entirely of students from
your own class. If you can get just one student from another class, you’ll
meet the requirements.”
In other words, we could form a group of ten people—the lower limit
—and then have nine of those students be from Class C. I couldn’t imagine
that kind of group composition would be unanimously approved when we
held our school-wide discussions, though. Very few students would be
willing to join a group almost entirely composed of people from another
class.
However, I doubted a group like that would meet unanimous school-
wide approval. Very few students would likely be willing to join a group that
only had members from another class.
Also, was it better to have more people, or fewer? The same number?
If the difference in numbers could create an advantage or disadvantage, a
smaller group was a risk. But we couldn’t know which number would be
superior without learning the test’s conditions. Our luck would depend on the
nature of the exam.
“I’m sure you’re wondering if it’s better to have more people in a
group or fewer. Numbers will certainly be significant to this test, as you’ll see
if you turn to the section marked ‘Outcomes’,” said Chabashira wryly. “I will
explain it now.”
Apparently, it was easy to tell we’d all been thinking the same thing.
“Excuse me, but could you please continue explaining the rules first? I
want to learn about the outcomes, but before that, I’d like to know what we’ll
be doing as a group,” asked Hirata.
“I suppose you’re right. If I respond to every one of Ike’s concerns, we
won’t get anywhere.”
Ike scratched his head apologetically again.
“Each group will function like a temporary class. I say temporary, but
your time together will be significant. Group members will take classes
together, of course, but will also cook and clean, bathe and sleep together.
8
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
You’ll be sharing a variety of life experiences.”
Both guys and girls let out agonized wails when they heard the words
‘bathe and sleep together.’
“I really don’t feel like I could live with people from the other classes
though,” grumbled Ike. I understood how he felt. Though we’d cooperated
with another class during the Sports Festival, that had been a brief and
temporary alliance. we hadn’t spent much time together. We hadn’t exactly
been together through thick and thin.
However, this exam was about to collapse those boundaries.
Depending on how things went, some groups might even wind up with a mix
of people from all four classes.
“As for outcomes, those are determined by a comprehensive test given
on the last day of camp. The contents of this rather significant test are
outlined on page 7 of your handouts. Give it a look.”
Everyone checked that section.
 
Ethics
Fortitude
Discipline
Initiative
 
These weren’t typical school subjects. This exam was going to be
something removed from the course of normal classes like English or
mathematics, which tested academic ability, huh? Unfortunately, I doubted
the tests we were about to face would have clear answers. The four concepts
outlined in the syllabus were abstract ones. I had yet to see any concrete
details of how the test would be conducted.
The schedule laid out in the syllabus only proved my point. After
waking up, we’d do morning assignments. Then we would gather at the dojo
and engage in zazen, meditative discipline exercises (such as cleaning),
followed by breakfast, then by various lessons in a classroom setting. After
lunch, students would work on afternoon assignments, and then practice more
9
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
zazen. Then we would have dinner, bathe, and go to bed. Quite the departure
from our lifestyle up until now.
Incidentally, unlike our usual school routine, there would be additional
lessons on Saturday mornings. We’d only have Sunday off.
“More details about your schedule will be announced upon arrival at
camp. Right now, I cannot tell you what kind of exam you will face on the
final day,” added Chabashira.
So we’d need to stay on our toes and play things by ear during the
special exam. Maybe the final day would test us on things like zazen,
including fine details like posture and manners. Words like Speech and
Production jumped out at me as I scanned the syllabus. They didn’t feel like
good signs.
“Choosing your groups will be of the utmost importance. All six
groups must work together and get through the week-long school camp as a
unit. No matter the reason, you cannot withdraw from your group at any time,
nor can members be changed. If a student has to withdraw due to illness or
injury, then their group must simply deal with their absence and operate as
though that student is still part of the group.”
In other words, we’d get nowhere if there was discord within the
group, or if we antagonized each other. It was looking more and more like we
were going to have to juggle vying with other classes with balancing the
internal functioning of our own group.
Going by the schedule, lessons began tomorrow morning, which was
Friday. We’d be in session until Wednesday of next week. Next Thursday, all
grade levels would take the final exam.
“Once the first-year students have finished creating their groups, they
will rendezvous with the second- and third-year students, who will form their
own groups at the same time. In the end, we will have six final groups, each
consisting of a mix of approximately thirty to forty-five first-, second-, and
third-year students.”
It was already tough forming a group within the same grade level, but
now we were adding other grade levels on top of that. The bus got weirdly
quiet.
“To put it more simply,” Chabashira said, “think of groups formed of
10
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
students in the same grade level as small groups. The groups formed from
students in all grade levels, on the other hand, will be large groups.”
Each of the six groups formed by students in the same grade level
would be a small group. Then those small groups would join with the second-
and third-years to ultimately form six large groups.
“Outcomes will be determined based on the average exam results of all
members of the six individual large groups. The strengths and weaknesses of
the other grade levels will heavily influence your results.”
What concerned me here was the difference in group membership
numbers. The large groups would consist of about forty people. Averaging
out our results should help reduce inequality, but depending on how the
smaller groups were formed, there might be significant differences in the
number of people in the large groups.
How we chose to form those large groups was now the most important
thing. If this were an academic exam, a large group with only exceptional
students in it would easily win. Conversely, students who were deemed
unexceptional would inevitably be excluded from the top groups, thus forced
to form a lower ranked group. However, this exam couldn’t be won by
simply gathering the academically gifted in one place.
“I think you’ve probably got the gist of things now. I’ll conclude with
the most important piece of information—that is to say, the results of this
special exam.”
Good question. What did we stand to lose?
“The members of large groups whose averaged scores take first
through third place will receive both private points and class points. Large
groups whose average scores place fourth or below should expect to have
points deducted,” explained Chabashira.
The details were, naturally, outlined in the syllabus.
 
Basic Rewards
1st Place: 10,000 private points. 3 class points.
2nd Place: 5000 private points. 1 class point.
11
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
3rd Place: 3000 private points.
The aforementioned rewards will be distributed to each individual
student.
 
So if a small group of ten people included nine people from the same
class, that class would be awarded twenty-seven class points as a result of the
group taking first place. Of course, that was describing an ideal scenario, but
it would be best to aim to have as many students as possible from our class
take first place.
However, the more students from the same class there were in a group,
the more points that class would have deducted if the group ranked fourth or
below. And the larger the group, the trickier it would be to control everyone.
The negatives at stake outweighed the relatively few positives.
 
4th Place: –5000 private points.
5th Place: –10,000 private points. –3 class points.
6th Place: –20,000 private points. –5 class points.
The aforementioned penalties will be deducted from each individual
student.
 
Private points and class points couldn’t fall below zero, but the
deductions would remain as a cumulative deficit that would be applied
against any points awarded for future exams. It was something the school had
never done before. If the rewards seemed relatively small, compared to the
risks, it was because there was a trick to it.
Chabashira read the next section aloud.
“Depending on the number of classes represented in a small group,
rewards may be multiplied. They may also be multiplied based on the total
number of people in a small group. Please relax, though. These multipliers
only apply to rewards gained from placing first, second, or third. They do not
apply to the point deductions for fourth place and below.”
These potential reward multipliers went as follows.
12
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
If a small group comprised students from two classes, they would
receive only the base rewards. However, a small group comprising students
from three classes would be rewarded with double the amount of class and
private points. A group comprising students from all four classes would be
rewarded with triple the amount of class and private points.
Finally, the multiplier changed depending on the number of people in a
small group. A group of ten people got the base reward. A group of fifteen
people got 1.5 times the reward. In the special event that a small group had
only nine people, their reward would be 0.9 times the default.
In other words, if a group comprising students from all four classes
obtained first place, they’d hit the 3× multiplier. If that same group also had
the maximum number of allowed members, i.e., fifteen, they’d earn an
additional 1.5× multiplier. Rounded to the nearest whole integer, this meant
each member of the group would be awarded 45,000 private points and
fourteen class points.
So far, this seemed like a standard special exam; tricky but interesting.
But what came next changed everything.
“Also…” Chabashira said. “There is a significant penalty for the large
group that comes in last place.”
“A penalty…? No way.”
“Yes. The penalty is expulsion.”
No surprises there.
“Granted, not every member of the large group that comes in last will
be expelled. If we did that, we’d be expelling nearly forty students at once.
Expulsion will only apply to the small group within that large group whose
average score falls below the threshold set by the school.”
So overall rankings were calculated based on the average score of each
large group, but when it came to expulsions, it was the average scores of the
small groups that were taken into account. That was troubling.
“If a small group fails to meet that standard, then that small group’s
representative will be expelled.”
“How do we pick the representatives?”
“You will discuss it with the members of your small group and appoint
13
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
somebody. That is all.”
“The hell? Who’d willingly want to be the representative knowing they
might get expelled?”
I doubted there’d be many volunteers.
“There are significant benefits to being a group representative. The
representative and the representative’s classmates will receive double the
rewards.”
“Did you say double?” muttered Horikita, who had been silent until
now.
“That’s right. To secure the highest possible payout from this exam,
you would have to form a group comprising twelve Class C students and one
student from each of the remaining three classes. If you then appoint
someone from Class C as your representative and take first place…”
“Wh-what do we win?” asked Yamauchi, unable to perform the
calculations himself. He was practically hyperventilating.
“You’d get 1.08 million private points and 336 class points.”
“Th-three hundred thirty-six?!”
If that happened, it would overturn the class rankings entirely. Even
jumping all the way to A Class as a result of this exam wasn’t out of the
question, depending on how the other groups scored. The more risks we took,
the greater the rewards—and the odds of securing the highest achievable
reward weren’t too low, either.
“Once the small groups have been decided, you will have until
tomorrow morning to appoint your representative. In the event a group
cannot choose a representative, that group will immediately be disqualified,
and every single one of its members will be expelled. Of course, no group
would ever be so stupid as to make such a mistake.”
So the school wouldn’t be picking representatives—it was solely up to
us to decide who to appoint. A difficult decision, to be sure. If no one
volunteered, we might wind up having to draw straws or play rock-paper-
scissors…an inevitable conclusion in light of the fact we’d all be expelled
otherwise, but in an already fraught situation such as this, it would put a
strain on the group’s unity.
14
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Finally, the representative who is expelled may choose one other
person from within their group to share their fate. We’re calling this one the
solidarity rule. Think of it as going down together.’”
“H-huh?! What’s with that?! That’s just crazy! So, if we appointed
some random dude as the representative, they could take down the leader of
another class?!”
I couldn’t imagine it would be that easy. Selecting a representative
would involve a certain degree of screening. We probably wouldn’t be
picking obvious sacrificial pawns to fill the role, and if we did, it would be
the group’s fault. It was unlikely we’d find someone willing to both sacrifice
themselves for the group’s sake and take down a student from an enemy class
in the process…unless, of course, we were talking about someone who’d
been trapped in Class D for years and was on the verge of dropping out
anyway.
But if there were students who were contemplating giving up in that
way, their peers were probably aware of the fact.
“Don’t worry,” Chabashira said. “The representative can’t just take any
student down with them. Only students whom the school deems contributory
to the group’s failure can be selected for expulsion in this way. Unless you
deliberately score poorly or boycott the test, you’ll be fine.”
Well, that was something, at least. However, I had my doubts about the
representatives for this exam. This was unlike any previous situation we’d
been in—particularly the fact that this time, the exam was the same for all
grade levels. The other classes were probably receiving the exact same
instructions right now.
In other words, many different strategies were currently in the process
of being formed. This wasn’t just a fight between the first-years. The second-
years were battling other second-years and third-years other third-years.
I sent off a text message to a certain individual, hoping to clear a few
things up. I wanted to know if the student council was somehow involved in
creating this special exam.
“One more important detail. If a student is expelled, that student’s class
will be penalized accordingly. The specifics of the penalty change depending
on the exam. In the case of this test, one hundred points will be deducted
15
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
from the class. If the class has insufficient class points to pay off the penalty,
they will be in debt. Until that debt is paid off, their total will remain at zero.”
The benefits were enormous, but the negatives were just as vast. The
promise of doubling your points by being a group representative was
tantalizing, but it came with the risk of being expelled. No one would
willingly volunteer for such a role unless they were confident in the abilities
of their small group. Nor, however, would they want the spoils of the
representative’s victory to go to another class.
Then there was the solidarity rule, which was clearly designed to leave
you at an impasse.
“That concludes my explanation. I will now open the floor for
questions.”
Hirata immediately raised his hand.
“If someone were to be expelled…would there be any way to help that
person, like a lifeline?” he asked.
“If you’re expelled, you’re expelled. Nothin’ ya can do ’bout it,”
replied Sudou.
Hirata rejected that outright. “That can’t be true. You were almost
expelled once, Sudou-kun, but were saved thanks to Horikita-san’s quick
thinking. It would be strange if there was nothing we could do.”
Chabashira smiled.
“That’s correct. You can buy a Revocation of Expulsion using private
points as a last resort. Naturally, the price will be high. The Revocation of
Expulsion costs twenty million private points and an additional three hundred
class points. This lifeline will only prevent a student’s expulsion. It won’t
cancel out the penalties suffered by the class as a result of that expulsion. Of
course, if you don’t have the points to pay for the lifeline, then that option is
unavailable.”
An exorbitant price. It meant a minimum of four hundred class points
would be required to save a student on the brink of expulsion, which made it
a lifeline we were unlikely to extend. The whole class would have to pay a
great toll to save one person.
“Regarding the twenty million points you mentioned, can the entire
16
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
class pitch in?” asked Hirata, who was clearly considering a future where we
might use the lifeline.
“Yes, everyone may pitch in. But this is completely irrelevant, since
you have only a few points available.”
With that, Chabashira was done reviewing the materials.
“There isn’t much time left before we reach our destination. You are
free to use the remaining time however you like. Right before we arrive, I
will re-collect the handout. Also, the use of phones will be forbidden for a
week. I will be collecting those shortly. Other than that, you are free to bring
daily necessities or playthings along with you, but not food. Perishables must
be consumed before we arrive, or you’ll have to throw them away before you
get off the bus. That’s all.”
Students who hadn’t reacted to the dangers of the special exam now let
out agonized wails at that last comment. We’d already gone through this on
the uninhabited island, but I supposed it was painful to have your phone
confiscated for a whole week.
“I have a question!” Ike raised his hand energetically. “You said that
guys and girls would be separate, but, like, exactly how spread out are we
gonna be?”
Chabashira wore a wry smile. “There are two buildings at the camp.
The boys will use the main building, and the girls will take the other. The
buildings are next to one another, but you’ll be living apart from each other
for a week. You will not be allowed to go outside during recess or after
school without permission either.”
“So we won’t be able to talk to each other?”
“No, boys and girls will take meals together in the cafeteria in the main
building for one hour a day. The school issues no directives to students
during that time period. You can do as you please then. Understand?”
“Yes!” Ike rejoiced, probably happy he’d be able to talk to girls.
I sat up slightly and glanced at Shinohara, who was sitting nearby.
While she looked slightly exasperated, her face brightened at Ike’s words.
Maybe their Christmas dinner had gone well.
“If there are no further questions, that’ll be all,” said Chabashira,
17
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
probably anticipating a lot of silly questions coming her way.
“Sensei. May I borrow your microphone?” asked Hirata.
“Of course.” Chabashira handed it over and returned to her seat. Hirata
took her place at the front of the bus.
“Based on what sensei said, we’re running out of time. Still, I’d like to
try to hear everyone’s opinions. How can we get through this exam? What
kind of groups should we shoot for?”
“Wouldn’t it be best if we tried to get as many of our classmates in as
possible? Pick twelve toppers and then get one person from every other class.
That’d be perfect,” said Sudou.
“That would be ideal, but I doubt three students from other classes
would want to join that group. They’d naturally be on their guard.”
It would be obvious that such a group wanted to win badly. I couldn’t
imagine single students from each of the other classes being willing to join
them. Besides, if such a group ranked poorly, the damage to the class would
be considerable.
“Hey, if all the smart people get in one group, then the rest of us don’t
stand a chance,” said Yamauchi. Apparently, he still hadn’t figured out that
this wasn’t about academics. “I mean, we really wanna get some private
points ourselves.”
His complaints were understandable. This issue had come up during
the exam on the cruise ship too. The large group who ranked first would earn
private points, but the students in the bottom groups gained nothing. In fact,
they would lose a great deal. Given that, most people obviously wanted to bet
on the winning horse by joining a large group that was likely to win.
“If everyone here agrees, I’d like to propose an even distribution,”
Hirata said. “We don’t know which group will come out on top. If any of us
gain private points from this exam, we’ll distribute those points evenly across
the class. That should be fine, since point transfers are allowed.”
And if we got hit with a deduction, it wouldn’t be so bad, since
everyone would be sharing the load.
“Ah, I see. That’s okay.”
Of course, the more exceptional students would complain about this,
18
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
but considering what was at stake, a consensus seemed likely.
“Heh.”
After hearing Hirata’s proposal, Chabashira chuckled, facing away
from him.
“I didn’t tell you this because you didn’t ask, but as a reward for your
promotion to Class C, I will give you one bit of helpful advice.”
Advice?
Hirata looked cautious, not ready to accept this reward at face value.
“When the rules don’t forbid it, you’re certainly free to transfer points.
Be it in the middle of an exam or in the course of your daily life—you can
transfer points as much as you please, as long as you don’t break any rules in
the process. However, private points are not pocket money. You’d do well to
remember that.”
“Are you saying we could, like, transfer to any class we wanted if we
accumulated like twenty million points? Or is this about the lifeline?”
“I’m saying there are many different ways of using private points.
Having as little as one point can help you in a time of need. Getting along and
supporting each other isn’t always going to be the correct answer, you
understand? For example, let’s say Ike made a mistake that would lead to him
being expelled unless a million private points were paid right away—and the
school disallowed transferring points in that instance. Ike would have to
produce the million points himself or be expelled. What then? If you divide
your points up equally, you might end up doing something you can’t take
back.”
Ike gulped loudly when he heard himself used as an example.
“You can’t count on other students to save you, because every single
one of them might find themselves in need the next moment. The only one
who can protect you is you, yourself,” said Chabashira. “People who work
hard are rewarded. That much is obvious. Once you enter the real world, it’s
exceedingly unlikely you’ll find people who’d gladly share their salary and
bonuses with friends.”
Perhaps we should be grateful for the advice…but this was just going
to make it harder to unite the class. I didn’t doubt everything she was saying
19
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
was true; I couldn’t imagine any teacher at this school would stir up trouble
just because there was no precedent for something. Chabashira always played
by the rules.
That said, there was more to this conversation.
I was sure there had been prior instances of individuals saving up
private points. But conversely, I was equally sure there had been incidents
where students were saved because their classmates had accumulated a great
many points. How did I know this? Well, from personal experience. In the
past, Horikita and I worked out a solution to provide Sudou with points when
it seemed he was about to be expelled. That then set a precedent.
Ultimately, sharing points evenly among ourselves could be seen as a
preventative measure to be deployed in unforeseen situations. Having
individual students hold onto a large number of points raised the risk of that
person embezzling those points or betraying the class.
Chabashira had just said something that disrupted her own class’s
chances at cohesion. I couldn’t reject the possibility that it was just school
policy, of course, but…
“Well, shall we put it to a majority vote? I’d like to at least hear what
everyone is thinking. Can the people who want to split the rewards please
raise your hands? It’s okay if you change your mind later,” said Hirata. He
lifted his hand at once.
Only a few hands went up. Most of my classmates looked worried.
Coming together as a class was important, sure, but when push came to
shove, you had to have a way to protect yourself. Most students probably had
only somewhere between ten thousand to a hundred thousand private points.
Given that, it was no wonder many wanted to keep those points as a safety
net.
Students who lacked confidence in their own abilities, on the other
hand, were more likely to want points to be shared across the class. There
were a few more such students than I’d expected, but in the end, less than
half the class raised their hands.
“Thank you.”
The majority was against point splitting. Hirata’s motion had failed.
20
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Was my advice unnecessary, Hirata?” Chabashira asked.
“No, I’m thankful for it. It’s valuable information at this stage.”
My phone vibrated. Thinking the certain individual whom I’d
messaged might have replied, I took my phone out of my pocket—but it was
his little sister, Horikita, who’d texted me. Naturally, it was about the special
exam.
“Do you have any ideas?” she wrote. Jeez, always trying to make me
do things.
“None,” I replied. After thinking it over, I sent another message.
“Guys and girls are going to be separated in this exam. I can’t help with
anything. Do your best.”
My attempt to offer her some encouragement. I was sure Horikita had a
lot she wanted to say in return, but I didn’t want to listen. I closed the text
thread and checked on another of my group chats: that of the Ayanokouji
Group (named after myself, but not in a boastful way).
Keisei, Akito, and even Airi and Haruka all happily discussed the
exam. I read through their texts, closed the chat without adding any
comments, and resumed listening to Hirata.
“We don’t have enough time to come up with a strategy,” he was
saying. “If the boys and girls are going to be separated, sending advice to
each other will get tricky.”
“No way…” The girls looked understandably uneasy at the prospect of
being unable to turn to Hirata, who held the class together and had always
been a guy they could rely on.
“Since the boys won’t be able to lend a hand, I think the girls should
decide on a leader right now. Will you accept the role, Horikita-san?”
Hirata had probably been chewing over this since Chabashira began to
explain the exam. He’d singled out Horikita because she was the only one
capable of handling the role.
“Very well. If anyone’s having difficulties, feel free to approach me at
any time. I don’t mind,” replied Horikita. She showed no signs of
displeasure, but, even though she was gradually becoming more of a person
our classmates could depend on, she didn’t warrant anywhere near the level
21
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
of trust that Hirata did. Of course, being Horikita, she was surely aware of
that.
“However, I’m sure quite a few of the other girls will find me lacking,”
she continued. “I don’t like to say this of myself, but I have a somewhat
abrasive personality.”
Yeah, that really wasn’t something anyone would want to admit.
“Which is why I’d like Kushida-san to assist me. What do you think?”
said Horikita, directing this to Kushida, who sat near the front of the bus.
“W-will I even be useful?” asked Kushida.
“Of course. Everyone in our class trusts you.”
“Um… Well, okay. If you’d like, I’ll help.”
“Thank you. In the event someone finds it difficult to speak directly
with me, you can do so via Kushida-san. I don’t mind. I will respond to any
issue, no matter how trivial.”
While Kushida’s trustworthiness was a matter of some concern, this
strategy was unquestionably the best we had right now. The exam rules made
it fairly difficult for guys and girls to meddle in each other’s affairs. Despite
being held in the same general facility, our classes and tests would take place
in separate locations. The guys would have no opportunity to participate in
any of the battles being fought on the girls’ side. With our phones being
confiscated to boot, our only opportunity for contact would be the one hour
we had for dinner.
That being said, it was vital we be able to gather as much information
as possible. I was going to need a gofer to funnel information to me from the
girls. Kushida worried me. This left Horikita or Kei as options, and the
former had a lot on her plate right now. I also had to consider the fact that she
tended to read too much into my intentions and take unnecessary actions.
More importantly, if she was going to be fielding consultation pleas
from the other girls, she probably wouldn’t have energy to spare for much
else. I supposed I’d have to use Kei after all, though I couldn’t force her to
survey the entire group by herself.
I sent the bare minimum of necessary information over to Kei’s phone.
She immediately replied with a blank message to confirm receipt. Given we’d
22
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
just learned that the unique nature of this test would force the guys and girls
to do battle separately for a while, she must have assumed I’d be contacting
her.
Kei probably wanted some advice herself right now. Considering the
rules of this exam, particularly the ones about the representatives and their
ability to take someone down with them, it wasn’t outside the realm of
possibility that Kei might wind up as a sacrificial pawn. I couldn’t say she
was doing well at the moment, whether in terms of her test scores or her
behavior in class.
That was why I was going to teach her a few tricks to protect herself.
They weren’t things that every student could pull off, but they could keep
you safer, if only slightly so.
As for me, I couldn’t really care less about the special exam. I had no
intention of executing any winning strategies. All I wanted was to make it
through safely and without incident.
This didn’t mean I wouldn’t be making any moves at all—like what I’d
just done by giving Kei advice. In a worst-case scenario, this special exam
could lead to several students getting expelled from C Class. I couldn’t
protect the entire class by myself. I had to narrow down the list of people I
wanted to safeguard.
Besides myself, I wanted to protect Kei, who’d become a staunch ally,
and Hirata. Considering my involvement with the student council, I needed to
ensure that Horikita stuck around, too. Then there were my friends: Keisei,
Akito, Haruka, and Airi. They couldn’t be my top priority, but as their friend,
I certainly hoped they wouldn’t be expelled.
Finally, given this rare opportunity for grade levels to intermingle, I
should keep an eye on Nagumo’s movements. Any other minor skirmishes
that occurred around me were beneath my notice.

THE BUS GOT OFF the highway and began to drive up the paved
mountain road. I wondered why our school outings always took place in
nature, like this location or the ocean.
At any rate, a new special exam was about to begin. Given they were
confiscating our phones, this was certainly going to be that annoying kind of
test where you had to gather information either on your own or by using your
connections. And, since more information would be leaked the more
carelessly you acted, prudence and discretion would be vital.
“I’m not cut out for this…” I muttered, letting my honest thoughts slip
forth.
No matter how many special exams we went through, I just couldn’t
get used to them. I’d so rarely had to cooperate with other people before.
“We will arrive shortly,” Chabashira said. “Once there, you will form
your groups. Then, as soon as room assignments have been completed, you
will have lunch, followed by free time in the afternoon.”
“That means… Yay! We don’t have to study!” Ike beamed at me.
True, but this wasn’t vacation. It was a school day. Even taking the
travel time into account, it was odd that they were letting us off the hook this
afternoon—it felt almost like a normal field trip, which couldn’t be right.
The bus pulled into the stop and slowed to a halt.
“When your name is called, hand over your phone and get off the bus.
Ayanokouji. Ike—”
Chabashira started with the boys, calling our names in syllabary order.
I turned my phone off and put it in a plastic box that sat next to our teacher.
As I disembarked from the bus, an unfamiliar teacher approached, instructing
us to wait a short distance away from the bus.
“Dude, it’s cold!” shouted Ike, hugging himself tightly. Probably
because we were in the mountains. It was certainly colder here than at school.
However, the sight before us made us forget the cold for a moment.
24
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Whoa. What is this place? This seems a lot for a ‘school camp’…”
Enormous grounds spread out before us, with some extremely old-
fashioned school buildings visible in the distance. Our home for the next
week. They were huge, probably because they had to accommodate the
students of all three grade levels.
It felt similar to the test on the uninhabited island. As with that test, I
really didn’t have much experience living out in the wilds like this. People
like Ike, who had been a boy scout, were going to be useful here. So would
those like Sudou, with their physical strength.
The girls filed off the bus next. It seemed like Horikita wanted to come
talk to me, but unfortunately, we were already being queued up into separate
lines. The boys and girls each headed for our respective school buildings,
with the boys being directed to the larger one, referred to as the main
building. Once inside, I found my nostrils tickled by the nostalgic scent of the
wood-paneled interior.
“This really is a traditional wooden school building, isn’t it? It’s old,
but still beautiful. It must be exceptionally well maintained,” said Hirata.
Everyone else agreed.
Along the way, we saw what appeared to be a classroom. There was no
air conditioning, only a single stove placed in the center of the room. We’d
most likely be having classes from tomorrow in rooms like that.
Finally, we arrived at what seemed like a gymnasium. The guys from
Class A and Class B, who were already there, looked over our way. The
Class D students showed up right after us, so the second- and third-year
students were probably on their way in next.
We were ordered to form a line and await further instruction. Classes A
and B looked calm and didn’t chat amongst themselves. They’d probably
already finished strategizing on the bus, huh?
25
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
2.2
 
BOYS FROM EVERY grade level assembled inside the gymnasium. The
bashful first-year students clumped together to wait in silence, and soon after,
a teacher from one of the senior classes took to the stage, microphone in
hand.
“I’m going to assume you all understand the contents of the exam after
the explanation you were given on the bus ride,” he addressed us. “Each
grade level will now hold internal discussions and form into six small groups.
The large groups will be formed at 8:00 p.m. today. That is all. As a
reminder, the school will play no part in the formation of these groups,
whether large or small. Nor will school officials act as mediators.”
Okay, then. I wondered what the other classes’ strategies were? They
should have some plans in place already, but…we’d see how it went.
Each grade level—first-, second-, and third-years—distanced
themselves from one another, and the discussions began. I was curious about
what the seniors were doing, but it was hard to make out any details from
here.
As I attempted to observe them, though, there was already movement
taking place within the first-year classes. I’d thought we’d try to feel each
other out a little longer, but Class A got straight to work, forming one large
group. A pretty attention-grabbing move, given the stalemate we were in.
There were twenty boys in first-year Class A. Fourteen of them formed
up into a single group, then made the following declaration to the people in
Class B and below.
“As you can see, we in Class A intend to form a single group in this
fashion. We have fourteen people at present and need one more person to
meet the requirements. We are looking for someone to join us.”
The person who said this was a Class A student named Matoba. I saw
Katsuragi among the fourteen boys in the group, but if Matoba was the
leader, did that mean Katsuragi wasn’t the representative either? At any rate,
this made it clear that Class A’s strategy was to form a group made up of as
26
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
many of their own people as possible.
“Hey, hey! What the hell are you selfish punks doing? It ain’t fair if
you’re the only ones who go and do something like that,” said Sudou, glaring
angrily at Class A.
“Is it selfish? Our group would comprise students representing only
two classes. Even if we take first place, our modifier will be low. I don’t
think this is a greedy proposal at all.”
“W-well, sure. But it’s unfair that there’s fourteen of ya.”
“On the contrary, it’s very fair. Since the remaining three classes can
create three groups of fifteen people each, you can all make groups similar to
ours. Right?”
“Uh, I guess?” said Sudou, not quite understanding. He looked to
Hirata for help.
“That is correct, yes,” said Hirata.
“Then this discussion is pointless. By the way, we’ve agreed that the
six remaining boys from Class A will happily join whatever groups you
make, no matter their makeup,” said Matoba, smiling broadly. He turned to
Class B’s Kanzaki and Shibata as well.
“Um… Well, I guess this isn’t really a bad deal at all. What do you
think, Kanzaki?”
“Sorry, I need more time to answer that,” Kanzaki said.
“I can’t imagine that Class A students would go so far as to
deliberately drag the other classes down, but I suppose it’s best to be
cautious…”
Class A was pushing everyone to come to a decision right away, but
Kanzaki didn’t seem inclined to rush. In response to his stalling, Matoba
came back with a strongly worded statement. “You have five minutes. Please
make your decision by then.”
“A time limit? We’ve only just begun to discuss this. Class A gave us
an opinion, not an order—you don’t get to make an unilateral decision here.
A five-minute window is absurd.”
Despite Class A’s claim that going along with their proposal meant
27
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
each class could make their own group of fourteen people, it would be a lie to
say that this was fair for all classes. If you thought about it, Class A was the
only class that could afford not to care about a low reward modifier. They
were currently ranked first and leading in points.
“I suppose it wouldn’t be fair of us to make this decision solely by
ourselves,” Matoba said. “But you misunderstand. We’re not saying we
won’t negotiate after the five minutes are up. We’re just offering special
terms for someone within that five minutes.”
“Special terms?”
Matoba continued to control the conversation, precisely because the
other classes had yet to solidify what they wanted. This was certainly close to
what you’d call a preemptive strike.
“Class A is going to form one group of fourteen people, meaning we
require one student from another class. Setting aside the merits of this
strategy, it’s certainly true that we’re selfishly pushing this idea on you. As
such, the single person whom we will welcome into our group will receive
special treatment,” he explained eloquently.
This had to be the strategy they’d come up with on the bus.
“The student who joins our group will bear no risk whatsoever.
Katsuragi-kun will act as the group’s representative, and in the unlikely event
that we place last, he will take full responsibility. No one will be dragged
down via the solidarity rule. Of course, this only applies so long as the
special entrant doesn’t intentionally lower our scores or hurt our friends. If
your exam scores are genuinely poor despite your best efforts, that’s fine.”
So these were the special terms, huh?
“Are you serious…?”
The proposal had its merits. Gathering skilled team members in one
place to create a group with a high point modifier might be necessary to
advance a class, but it was those skilled people—the people at the very heart
of the class—who bore the risks of such a strategy going sour. From the
perspective of an average student, who grappled with fears of expulsion,
Matoba’s proposed system of special treatment wasn’t a bad idea at all. It
would guarantee they made it safely through this special exam.
28
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Still, why wasn’t Katsuragi the one suggesting this? Was this the
fallout of him losing status within the class?
“We intend to take first place, meaning there is a strong possibility that
our special entrant will be rewarded with private points. Aren’t many of you
nervous about this special exam?” asked Matoba, looking around. His words
clearly resonated with the less secure students. “However, if you cannot
decide within the five-minute window, the special offer expires. In the
unlikely event that our class does receive a penalty, we will not hesitate to
drag that student down with us.”
“It’s an interesting proposal. But after the five minutes have passed, the
value of joining your group plummets significantly. No one wants to join a
team with such a high risk of taking them down with it,” said Kanzaki.
“Yeah, that’s right. Who’d be crazy enough to do that?” said a student
who’d been briefly charmed by the idea of the special terms.
“I don’t mind what you think. But these are our terms,” said Matoba,
taking a step back. His group moved with him, signaling the end of the
discussion.
“I think we’re better off ignoring them. Once five minutes have passed,
no one will want to join their group. They’ll be back,” said Kanzaki.
“Suppose so,” said Shibata.
Having said that, they moved calmly away. I didn’t see Kaneda and the
other newly demoted Class D students making any strange movements either.
Hirata, however, seemed to be the sole person who felt differently
about Class A’s proposal. He approached Keisei, Akito, and me, asking,
“What do you think?” in a low voice.
“About their strategy?” replied Keisei, taking the lead in the
conversation.
“Yeah. Surprisingly enough, I don’t think it’s a bad deal. It is
absolutely essential that everyone in Class C makes it through. We’ve only
just been promoted, and I don’t want any of my classmates to be expelled. If
a student who’s nervous about this exam joins Class A’s group, they should
be able to rest easy,” said Hirata.
As a defensive strategy, Class A’s proposal had its merits.
29
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Of course, it remains to be seen whether Class A will keep their
promise of special treatment. If they wind up taking last place, they might use
the solidarity rule to take someone down with them, after all,” he added.
Hirata’s anxieties were understandable. Verbal agreements were
binding in nature, but even if we confronted Class A about it in the wake of a
betrayal, they could trap us in endless arguments that went nowhere. If they
feigned ignorance, then things would get complicated. After all, their promise
hinged on no one intentionally sabotaging the group. If a student’s exam
scores were low, it would be difficult to prove whether or not it was
intentional.
Still, we couldn’t exactly get it in writing; there weren’t any pens or
paper at hand. The teachers had been ordered not to help, so asking them to
bear witness to a verbal promise would probably be useless too.
That being said, Matoba’s words had piqued the interest of all of the
first-year students. He stood to gain nothing by going back on his words. It
might be okay to trust Class A on this.
“…It might be possible to have them protect one person,” I stated,
joining Hirata and Keisei’s conversation.
“Yeah. If we make a move now, that just leaves the question of what B
and D decide…”
Accepting the offer would be seen as siding with Class A, who had
opted for a heavy-handed approach. Even though we only had a tiny window,
Hirata seemed to want to think this over until the last possible second.
Roughly three minutes had passed since Class A’s sudden proposal. We
didn’t know whether they were dutifully counting every second, but Matoba
and the others seemed to be leisurely standing by.
Maybe they were expecting someone to raise their hand. Or maybe
they were thinking up another strategy. We watched them carefully for the
remaining two minutes, waiting for them to make their move—though what
they would do, of course, depended on the leaders of classes B and below.
“Kanzaki-shi. I have a proposal. Would you care to hear it?” said
Kaneda.
Rather than whisper, he raised his voice boldly so that everyone could
hear, beckoning Hirata to join them too.

“I’ve determined that this is an opportunity we should seize,” he said.
“Thanks to Class A forming up like this, even if their group does happen to
win in this exam, they only get a point modifier for representing two classes.
Moreover, if we accept their conditions, we can assign the remaining Class A
students as we see fit. We could configure the remaining groups to include
students from all four classes, meaning the higher those groups ranked, the
greater the likelihood of their members closing the gap between their class
and Class A. Correct?”
“That’s only if we can rank higher than them, though.”
I didn’t know what the exact scores were, but during the Paper Shuffle,
Class A had destroyed Class B. In a test of academic skill, this could end
badly.
“It’s certainly risky. However, this isn’t merely a question of
academics. What do you think? I say we try to overthrow Class A here and
now,” said Kaneda.
In other words, have B, C, and D cooperate to lay siege against Class A
here.
“Letting Class A have a group of fourteen of their people is a small
price to pay, compared to the point multiplier for representing all four classes
in a single group. With their offer of special treatment on top of that, it should
work out perfectly.”
“That’s right. I like Kaneda-kun’s strategy,” said Hirata. Kanzaki,
more cautious, continued to ruminate on the benefits of having people from
all four classes in a single group.
“But who’s going to join Class A’s main group?” he said. “I doubt any
Class B students want to team up with them. Myself included.”
Even if the special entrant would be protected from expulsion, he’d be
spending the week in a group made up only of Class A students. It was safe
to say it wouldn’t be the most comfortable time.
“Let’s ask students from Classes B and D. Would anyone like to step
forward?” said Hirata.
We looked at each other. But no one raised their hand.
“Then I’d like to ask Class C. Would anyone like to step forward?”
31
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
asked Hirata, directing the question to our own class this time. But he got the
same reaction.
Some were likely considering the offer because of the special quota but
also anxious about having everyone’s eyes on them. Not to mention being
behind enemy lines for a week.
“This is just my opinion,” said Hirata, “but I think Class A will keep
their word.”
“How can you know that?”
“Because they’re Class A, I suppose. If they do force a lower-ranking
student into expulsion despite their promise, no one will ever trust them
enough to make a deal with them again. We’re only in the third semester of
our first year. To lose credibility now would be a significant setback.”
Hirata’s words made sense. If this were a final, decisive battle, Class A
might act without care for their reputation. But they still had over two years
to go. If they were seen to keep their word here, they could continue to use
similar methods in the exams to come. Hirata was saying they wouldn’t do
anything too reckless just yet.
“Not to praise an enemy, but this is Class A. Their grades are simply
better than ours. I doubt they’ll come last or drop below the average. Your
safety would be guaranteed.”
Ike and the others could understand that temptation well.
“Fortunately, there don’t appear to be any Class B or D candidates. I’d
like to choose someone from Class C to join A’s group. Even if they do win,
our class would benefit, and someone would avoid the chance of expulsion.
How does that sound?” said Hirata.
He specifically directed his gaze to Ike and Yamauchi, no doubt
wanting to protect students who were anxious about their abilities. He made
sure to confirm the truth of what he was saying with Matoba too.
“Even if the special entrant scores below the group’s average, do you
promise you won’t seek to punish them?” he asked Matoba.
“Of course. We ask nothing of that student. If they uphold the
conditions I outlined earlier, they have my word.”
“I suppose I’ll do it,” muttered Ike. Upon hearing that, Yamauchi said
32
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
the same.
“I think I would like to volunteer myself as well,” added the Professor,
bringing us to three candidates.
“To keep things fair, how about we settle this with rock-paper-
scissors? The winner joins the group,” suggested Hirata. They did just that,
with Yamauchi emerging victorious, making him the person chosen to join
Class A’s main group. And thus, the first group was formed. They reported to
Mashima-sensei, leaving the six remaining Class A students behind.
“Now we can form the remaining groups however we wish. I suppose
we could do as Class A suggested and form three groups of fourteen people
from the same class. And, just like Class A, we could pledge not to invoke
the solidarity rule against the one person from another class. Personally,
however, I would prefer we do as I had suggested earlier and blend all four
classes together.”
“That’s right. Now that we’re goin’ with Class A’s plan, I think we
should blend ’em.”
“No objections here. What do you say, Class C?”
Kanzaki and Kaneda’s strategy was one designed to secure the highest
point multiplier.
“If we’re aiming to win, this is what we need to do. No argument from
me.”
“Wait a minute, Hirata. Is this really okay? Like, I don’t wanna join a
group with someone like Ishizaki in it,” interrupted Sudou.
It wasn’t just Sudou either. Keisei and other Class C students felt
similarly, and grumbled complaints could be heard from a number of Class B
and D students too. Having students from all four classes got you a high
multiplier, but it also courted conflict. If students who fought like cats and
dogs got stuck in the same group, it might even affect scores.
“I understand. I don’t think this is something we can decide
immediately. What works for Class A may not work for us.”
Given how satisfied the Class A students looked, they’d probably
agreed to split the rewards equally among all their classmates. They might
even have promised to give the six students excluded from their main group a
33
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
greater share of the rewards to offset the greater risks they faced. They could
afford to do so precisely because they were Class A and in a relatively safe
position.
“Why don’t we form hypothetical groups for the time being? If anyone
objects, we can stop and start over.”
“Sounds good. Trying to feel things out wastes precious time and
won’t get us to a consensus, and Class A’s already moved onto the next
step.”
Arguing back and forth would get us nowhere. The other students must
have been leaving matters to their respective leaders, because there were
almost no dissenting opinions.
“No objections here,” said Kaneda, accepting the offer without any
resistance. We began to form groups smoothly and efficiently. Even though
no one had spoken up, though, many students still wore skeptical looks on
their faces.
Ryuuen, not Kaneda, had been Class D’s original leader. Everyone
here was aware of that. But Ryuuen wasn’t participating in the group
discussion at all. In fact, he was keeping his distance from everyone and
didn’t even look like he was paying attention. Now that the third semester
was underway, it was common knowledge that he’d vacated his position of
authority a while ago. Among the students who didn’t know the specific
details behind his fall, there were several who suspected that the whole thing
was a charade.
“I’d like to ask you something. Did Ryuuen tell you to do this?” asked
Shibata, voicing the question Hirata and even Kanzaki didn’t dare to.
Kaneda removed his glasses and blew dust off the lenses. “No. This
was my idea. His opinions are irrelevant. And even if he and I were
collaborating behind the scenes, I’m the one talking to you right now. Any
problem with that?”
His expression turned somewhat grim.
“I just wanted to make sure. Sorry if I offended you,” Shibata
apologized.
“You didn’t. Now let’s continue with our discussion. We don’t have
34
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
the time for chit-chat.”
Designing these groups was a tricky task. Each group would have to
work as a team, while their individual members tried to avoid expulsion and
assist their class at the same time. It might sound easy, but it wasn’t. The
process of group formation involved securing capable players while trying
not to get stuck with any duds.
We needed to make sure the students who were likely to drag the rest
down wound up in someone else’s group. Hirata, Kanzaki, and Kaneda chose
to act as representatives for their respective groups, shelving the matter of the
remaining small groups for now.
Immediate volunteers from Class C flocked to Hirata. Having a
classmate as your group representative meant you were probably safe from
being dragged down with them via the solidarity rule, and you already knew
them well to boot. A good way to minimize interference from other classes.
People clustered in this fashion, with Class B showing similar trends. Their
group members were decided faster than I could have imagined.
Class D was the last to form up, and they did so slowly. I probably
wasn’t the only one keeping my eye on them. Prominent students like
Kanzaki and Shibata were observing them, of course, but so were many
others, all curious to know exactly how Ryuuen Kakeru fit into the Class D
puzzle right now.
No one trusted Class D at all. Understandable, given how many times
Ryuuen Kakeru had tried to entrap us.
“What are you going to do, Kiyotaka?” Keisei and Akito came over to
check in with me.
“What about you?” I asked, batting the question back at them while
donning a conflicted expression face.
“I’m thinking of sticking with Keisei. I mean, using my head really
isn’t my strong suit.”
“…A group composed mainly of C Class students is appealing. It’s
just, well, to be honest…I’m not really satisfied with Hirata’s way of doing
things.”
“Meaning?” asked Akito, not understanding what Keisei was getting
35
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
at.
“Hirata focuses on protecting his comrades, rather than winning. That’s
not a bad thing, but it doesn’t advance us as a class. Also, Ike, Onizuka, and
Sotomura are hoping to join Hirata’s group. How they perform will depend
on the nature of the upcoming tests, of course. They might even score better
than me. But it’s far more likely that they won’t, given what this exam is
shaping up to be like.”
“Well, that’s true…”
“Class A isn’t an unruly mob. Even if Yamauchi drags them down, it’s
doubtful Hirata’s group could win against them. The only thing we
accomplish under his strategy is avoiding being taken out by the solidarity
rule. Given that, I think that I’d rather be the minority in another group. We
should aim for victory, using an elite few.”
“If this whole thing comes down to average scores, that’s a solid
approach, I suppose.”
There were eighty boys in the first year, twenty in each respective
class. If we divided them up, here’s how the four main groups would look:
 
GROUP A (14 A, 1 C) = 15 people
GROUP B (12 B, 1 A, 1 C, 1 D) = 15 people
GROUP C (12 C, 1 A, 1 B, 1 D) = 15 people
GROUP D (12 D, 1 A, 1 C, 1 B) = 15 people
 
That left twenty people (three from Class A, six from B, five from C,
six from D) who would probably have to form two groups. However, while
the majority of students were doing as their class leaders directed, some
didn’t seem inclined to cooperate. One such student was unmistakably Class
D’s Ryuuen Kakeru, who had avoided interacting with anyone, standing
around alone as if he had no interest in participating in this exam in the first
place.
Despite being alone, it didn’t look like he was wallowing in loneliness,
or anything. If anything, he looked like he was proudly waiting out his
36
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
solitude. Either way, one of the remaining groups was going to have to take
him in.
There was only one student I could imagine doing such a thing in a
situation where even Ishizaki, Ryuuen’s classmate, wouldn’t talk to him.
“Ryuuen-kun. Would you care to join our team?”
Of course, it was Hirata.
I could understand why someone like Ryuuen, who’d halfway retired
from inter-class competition, would find a mandatory-collaboration exam like
this one annoying. That said, he probably wouldn’t imprudently defy the
school’s will either.
“Wait, Hirata! Taking Ryuuen? That isn’t funny!”
Everyone who’d joined Hirata’s group resisted. Who’d want to work
alongside the ultimate ticking time bomb? Ryuuen was the single most
unnecessary element of a strategy to climb to Class A. The students
understood this—but at the same time, they had doubts rising within them.
Doubts, that is, about the scenario where they graduated “from a class
other than A.”
Failing to graduate in Class A meant they would never benefit from
this school’s too-good-to-be-true guarantee of getting you into any institution
or career you wanted. What was even the point of graduating if you couldn’t
do it in Class A?
That question haunted everyone at this school. It was the same kind of
mingled unease you got when good news and bad news reached you at the
same time. Without Class A, you’d be labeled an underperformer.
Universities or workplaces might outright refuse to admit or hire those who
didn’t have what it took.
Of course, there were undoubtedly many who held graduates of the
Advanced Nurturing High School in high regard. Spending three long, hard
years in the pure meritocracy of a government-sponsored school had its own
value. Graduating from this school at all was still a substantial achievement,
as long as you didn’t get your hopes up too high.
As for the second-year students, Nagumo was already top dog of Class
A, far ahead of Class B and below. With a year left to go, other classes could
37
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
still turn things around, but it was an uphill battle. The third-year students had
it tough, too. While their situation certainly wasn’t as one-sided as the
second-years, I had heard that Class A, where Horikita’s brother was placed,
had never once surrendered its lead and was still going strong.
At this point, there was almost no chance for the second- and third-
years in Class D to make any kind of comeback, barring some kind of
miracle… Maybe if this were one of those quiz shows where you could shoot
to first place simply by getting the crucial final question right. But I doubted
that would happen here.
Putting aside the first-year students who hadn’t yet grasped the bigger
picture, everyone was likely terrified of expulsion. I couldn’t imagine a
university or employer welcoming an expelled student with open arms.
The systems in place for this exam, like the solidarity rule, were
deterrents at best.
The systems in place in this exam, like the representative being able to
drag someone down with them, was at most a deterrent. It was a rule created
to ensure that students wouldn’t be getting forcefully expelled. However,
being vigilant was still important. There was still a possibility that there was a
student out there who didn’t mind getting expelled, and in the off chance that
a representative gets expelled, they probably wouldn’t hesitate to bring
someone else down with them.
This meant everyone would be wise to score higher than their
representative, even if only by one point, to escape the solidarity rule. Also, it
was important not to incur the representative’s wrath.
“Oh, ho, ain’t you a big shot, Hirata, takin’ me in. But it doesn’t look
like people are on board,” said Ryuuen.
That’s right. They wouldn’t agree, and the group wouldn’t form unless
Hirata managed to talk them into it.
“Hey, Keisei. Wouldn’t being part of an elite crew be pretty risky?”
muttered Akito, looking at the remaining members.
“Yeah, maybe more than I thought.”
Keisei let out an exasperated sigh. Aside from me, the remaining five
Class C students were Keisei, Akito, the Professor, Onizuka, and Kouenji.
38
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
The Professor and Onizuka had wanted to join Hirata’s group, but that group
was full up. As for Kouenji, he did his own thing, so to speak. He didn’t
participate in any discussion.
We could argue that we’d like those five to all stick together, but then
we’d have two groups of ten remaining, meaning the other classes wouldn’t
be able to make the same move. On top of that, since there were practically
no students left who would proactively step up and take on the role of
representative, students’ movements became rigid, as if time had come to a
halt.
“As long as I’m not in a group with Ryuuen, I’m good,” said a Class B
student.
“I’d also like to avoid Ryuuen,” said Keisei.
Everyone was on team Not Ryuuen, probably because they had no idea
what he might do next. Even his old allies, like Ishizaki, kept their distance.
Shiina Hiyori, who hadn’t been involved in that rooftop scuffle, might have
supported Ryuuen, but she wasn’t here.
“This isn’t going to be easy.”
“The best plan would be to put him with the Class D group.”
“That would be great, sure, but we’re in a bit of a bind right now.”
“I heard they had a falling out. But I don’t have enough evidence to
know if that’s true.”
It was understandable that Kanzaki—no, that everyone here—would
have doubts. They probably saw this whole situation as Class D intentionally
cutting Ryuuen loose in the hopes he’d sabotage someone else.
“Kanzaki-kun,” Hirata said. “If Ryuuen-kun really is having trouble, I
think that we should do something about it.”
“By ‘do something about it,’ you mean Classes B and C should help
him. Is that it?”
“Yes.”
“Even if it helps out Class D, two other classes would be hurt in the
process. If you weigh the risks, it’s not a good idea.”
Kanzaki was right. If including Ryuuen meant taking a risk, then that
39
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
risk should be shouldered by his own class. Kaneda and Ishizaki might not
like the situation, but they had no right to saddle another class with Ryuuen,
and we didn’t need to take responsibility for their problems.
Mind you, if we’d been competing in pairs, Hirata would probably
have paired up with Ryuuen in the blink of an eye. But this was a group test.
One person’s goodwill couldn’t carry the day, as evinced by the silence that
followed.
It seemed forming groups was going to take longer than expected. The
paranoia and suspicion emerging from the three groups that had formed right
off the bat as a result of excluding Ryuuen didn’t help.
40
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
2.3
 
“ALLOW ME to suggest something. The problem we’re facing right
now is Ryuuen. We’re fighting over which group to put him in, right? In that
case, I’d be willing to act as a group’s representative in exchange for that
group taking Ryuuen,” said Akito, who had been carefully observing the
situation next to me.
Of course, declaring that he would accept Ryuuen when no one else
wanted to instantly raised people’s suspicions.
“What are you plotting?”
“It’s simple. In return, I want the lion’s share of the reward for first
place.”
I didn’t think people would resist the idea, but then again, they all
understood that taking in Ryuuen came with great risks. It was just that,
well…I never imagined
Akito would make a move with the intention of getting the reward. I
suspected he was simply trying to come up with a reason to take Ryuuen in,
since no one else was willing to do so.
“What are you proposing, exactly? You’re not planning to use the
solidarity rule to take someone else down with you if it comes to that, are
you?”
“Unless someone tries to blatantly sabotage me, I won’t do that. And
the rules say I can’t, anyway.”
The members of the hypothetical groups fell silent after hearing
Akito’s well-reasoned argument. And so, despite encountering a few bumps
in the road, the first-years finally managed to form six groups.
This included my group, which was composed as follows:
From Class C, we had Kouenji, Keisei, and me. Three people.
From Class B, we had Sumida, Moriyama, and Tokitou. Three people.
From Class A, we had Yahiko and Hashimoto. Two people.
41
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Then, from Class D, we had Ishizaki and Albert. Two people.
Ten people in total.
Our group was clearly unlike the other five. We had a far more even
mix of students from different classes, though I supposed the group Akito
was representing wasn’t too far off. However, my group still needed a
representative. None of us seemed to have great leadership skills, and no one
was stepping forward to claim the role. With no one around to take the lead
and guide everyone toward a consensus, we all sat there, not knowing what to
say.
Anyway, we had to at least report to the school that we’d successfully
formed our group. We could select the representative later. So the ten of us—
group number six—headed over to report to the school officials.
“Even though we managed to avoid having Ryuuen, I’m still worried
about getting a decent average score,” said Keisei anxiously.
I wasn’t certain how good the other students were either. Personally,
I’d wanted to avoid being in the same group as Ishizaki and Albert, but there
was nothing to be done about it at this point. Ishizaki was blatantly refusing
to meet my eyes, but that didn’t necessarily mean that a third party was going
to notice anything was up. Most people would assume he simply thought
nothing of me.
“Kouenji is going to be a problem too,” I said.
If Kouenji would take things seriously, he’d be unstoppable. His
athletic and academic abilities were impressive. But “take things seriously”
was where things fell apart.
“I mean, he’s Kouenji, but he wouldn’t really do something that gets us
penalized, right? If he does, maybe it’s all over.”
I had a feeling Kouenji would score above average, but would do it in
an aimless, noncommittal way. The only certain thing about him was that his
motives were impenetrable. If he remained unmotivated, our future was
uncertain.
When we finished giving our report, I noticed a group hanging around.
It was the one with mostly Class A students, who should’ve been long gone.
At first, I thought they wanted to find out how the remaining five groups had
42
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
organized themselves, but it seemed that wasn’t the case. There were second-
and third-year students waiting around, too. More importantly, so was
Student Council President Nagumo Miyabi, who ruled the second-years with
an iron hand.
After confirming that all the first-year students had formed their
groups, he called out to me. “You guys were surprisingly quick. I thought
that would take you longer.”
It seemed the second- and third-year students were almost all done
composing their small groups too.
“I have a proposal for you first-years,” Nagumo said. “How about we
form a large group right now?”
“Aren’t we going to decide that tonight, Nagumo-senpai?”
“That’s just the school being flexible. They didn’t expect that the small
groups would form so quickly. Since all grade levels have finished, wouldn’t
it be best if we moved on to the next step?”
Apparently, his suggestion was unexpected—even to the teachers.
Sensing that we were about to start forming large groups, the teachers began
to move in a hurry. Since the student council president himself had proposed
this, the other students could hardly refuse.
“You don’t mind, do you, Horikita-senpai?”
“I don’t. This is more convenient for us too.”
Discussions were underway, with Nagumo at the center.
“So, how do we do this? Should we have a draft-pick system? One
person from each of the first-year small groups plays rock-paper-scissors
against the others. The outcomes determine the order in which people make
their picks. Based on that order, they can choose which second- or third-year
small groups they want, and thus we’ll get large groups. A fair and quick
process.”
“The first-years don’t have much information to go on. That doesn’t
seem fair.”
“It’s never going to be completely fair. We all have different amounts
of information, in the end.”
43
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
A brief but important conversation between Nagumo and Horikita’s
brother followed. There was no way a first-year could interrupt.
44
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
45
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“What do you first-years think? If you have any complaints, speak up,”
said Nagumo, knowing full well that no one would talk back to him.
“We have no objections,” answered Matoba, apparently now
representing the first-years.
“I see. In that case, how ’bout we get started?”
Nagumo smiled, and then joined up with his own small group. The
second- and third-year students reformed their groups so that it was easier for
us to tell them apart. Then the representatives of five small first-year groups
stepped forward. Nagumo regarded us fondly, like we were adorable
children.
“Now all that’s left is that group.”
My small group was the only one that had yet to pick a representative,
so naturally, none of us were stepping up to play rock-paper-scissors. I lightly
pushed Keisei, making sure I wasn’t noticed. He looked puzzled but then
reluctantly raised his hand.
The six representatives formed a circle and started playing. Keisei was
selected to pick fourth. First up was Matoba’s group, which was mostly filled
with Class A students. Second was Hirata’s group, consisting mostly of Class
C students. Third was the Class D group, represented by Kaneda.
“You can discuss among yourselves which group you’d like to pick.”
Two groups that immediately stood out as top choices: the group
containing the leader of second-year Class A, the student council president
Nagumo, and the group led by Horikita’s brother, a third-year student. But
someone like Hirata, who had many friends and acquaintances across
different grade levels, might be able to spot an excellent group that didn’t
appear to be one at first glance.
Matoba’s group, the first to pick, chose the third-year group containing
Horikita Manabu without hesitation. Next, Hirata carefully assessed each of
the eleven groups. In the end, he didn’t go with one of the two obvious
choices I mentioned but picked a group of third-years that didn’t have a
single person I recognized.
“Hey, Hirata, you sure that’s a good idea? Shouldn’t you pick the
student council president’s or something?” Ike interrupted, unsurprisingly.
46
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Yes, I’m sure. I think this is a good choice. Exceptional people have
their appeal, sure, but they can bring trouble in their wake. Besides, the
seniors I chose aren’t half bad,” replied Hirata, nodding with apparent
confidence.
Ike decided not to push the matter, a sign of the trust Hirata had
cultivated with our class.
The majority-Class-D group was next. Kaneda consulted his
classmates—which is to say he simply informed them which group he wanted
to choose. There were no objections, and he made his selection immediately.
“I would like to join second-year Gouda-senpai’s group, please.”
Once again, Nagumo’s group had been passed over.
“I wonder why they’re avoiding Nagumo,” I muttered doubtfully.
Akito, standing next to me, offered an answer.
“Because aside from Nagumo-senpai, the other members are kind of
iffy.”
“Is that so?”
“Well, I suppose they’re not all iffy, but there are a lot of C and D
guys. The second-year group with lots of Class A students is the one Kaneda
picked.”
In other words, it wasn’t that Kaneda had avoided picking Nagumo—
just that he had chosen reliable, strong allies. I was curious as to why
Nagumo hadn’t formed a group of mostly Class A students. I knew he
controlled all the second-years; bringing members of his own class together
seemed like a more reliable option.
Finally, it was Keisei’s turn. “Is it okay for me to decide?” he asked the
rest of the group.
“I don’t care. Don’t really get it, anyway,” said Ishizaki.
It seemed Ishizaki, and by extension the Class D students, were fine
with leaving the decision to Keisei. The Class A students had no real opinion
on the matter either. The Class B students said nothing at first, but after
thinking it over for a while, they made the following request.
“Please pick Nagumo-senpai’s group.”
47
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Though Nagumo’s group was mostly composed of Class C and D
students, I was guessing it was the presence of the council president that
made them rate it so highly. After hearing the Class B students’ request,
Keisei chose Nagumo’s group.
After that, discussion came to an end. The six large groups had formed
successfully.
“Horikita-senpai, since we’re in separate large groups, how about we
have ourselves a little contest?” proposed Nagumo. Horikita shot him a sharp
look.
I heard a somewhat exasperated sigh, and a third-year named Fujimaki
stepped forward to admonish Nagumo. I recognized him as the person who’d
taken charge during the Sports Festival, meaning he wielded a certain degree
of influence.
“Nagumo. How many times have you done this? Enough already.”
“Whatever do you mean, Fujimaki-senpai?”
“You keep challenging Horikita to competitions. I’ve never interfered
before, but this is a large-scale special exam that includes the first-year
students. You cannot treat this like your own personal game.”
“Why do you say that? Distinctions like first and third year no longer
apply right now. Challenging someone under such conditions is hardly
unusual, is it? There’s nothing in the special exam rulebook to forbid it.”
Rather than cower before Fujimaki’s impressive bulk, Nagumo chose to taunt
him.
“We’re talking fundamental morals here. Even if something isn’t
expressly against the rules, some actions are good, and some are bad. That’s
obvious.”
“I don’t really think so. If anything, it’s precisely seniors like you who
hinder the growth of younger students by refusing to do battle with them,
wouldn’t you say?”
“You may be student council president, but that doesn’t mean you can
do as you please. You need to be aware of the fact that you’re overstepping
your authority.”
“If you think that’s the case, then please, make me aware of it. How
48
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
about you be my opponent, Fujimaki-senpai? You’re third-year Class A’s
number two, aren’t you?” replied Nagumo, stuffing his hands arrogantly into
his pockets, acting as though Fujimaki were an afterthought.
It was cheap provocation, but it seemed to successfully antagonize
some of the third-years. A few students started to step forward. However,
Horikita kept them back.
“I have rejected your demands until now,” Horikita said. “Do you
know why?”
“Hmm, let’s see. I’d say it’s because your friends are scared you might
lose, but that can’t be right. You are superior to every other person I’ve met,
Horikita-senpai. You’re not afraid to lose. You never even think that you
could lose.”
The second-year students listening to Nagumo wore worshipful looks
on their faces. He wasn’t a friend or a patron. He was a rival, a hated enemy,
but also someone they deeply respected. It seemed he inspired a variety of
powerful emotions, anyway.
In the two years he’d been at this school, Nagumo had accomplished
many things that no ordinary person could. Not even the third-year students
could comprehend the extent of his achievements. The first-year students
even less so.
“I’m the same as you, Fujimaki-senpai. I don’t want any futile conflict
either.”
“The conflict you do want gets too many other people involved.”
“But that’s just how this school works. And I think that’s the best part
of it… Well, I suppose it comes down to a difference of opinion. At any rate,
I wish we could have had a little showdown in that relay during the Sports
Festival, senpai. Alas, that didn’t happen. I’m still really frustrated about that,
y’know?”
“I can’t imagine what a showdown between the second- and third-years
would do to help us in this exam.”
“You’re probably right. You’re that kind of person, senpai. But all I
want is a battle between the former student council president and the current
student council president. You’re going to graduate soon. Before that
49
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
happens, I want to see whether I’ve surpassed you.”
There was no telling if Nagumo would ever stop. It was like he was
possessed by some kind of unceasing longing.
“What would the battle even be?” Horikita asked.
The third-year students looked shocked at the implication he might be
about to accept Nagumo’s challenge.
“How about which of us can get the most students expelled?” replied
Nagumo.
Everyone, from first-years to third-years, started murmuring amongst
themselves.
“Stop joking.”
“I really do think that would be interesting. But if you insist…how
about which group can earn the higher average score? Simple and easy to
understand.”
“Very well. I accept.”
“Thank you. I knew you wouldn’t disappoint, senpai.”
“However, this is a personal battle between you and me. Don’t drag
anyone else into it.”
“Don’t drag others into it? Given the rules of this special exam, I
would think getting someone to drag your opponent’s group down was a
valid strategy.”
“That’s the very opposite of what the essence of this exam is meant to
be. This is, at most, an exercise to test our group’s unity. The point of the test
isn’t to exploit a weakness in an opponent’s group, even if you happen upon
one by accident.”
“…What does that mean?” said Ishizaki, seemingly directing his
question at Keisei.
“It means we play fair and square, based on our abilities and nothing
more. To put it simply—no dirty tricks. No kicking our opponents while
they’re down, like Ryuuen likes to do,” Keisei answered.
“I see.”
50
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Ignoring Keisei and Ishizaki, Horikita’s brother and Nagumo continued
with their discussion.
“If you don’t agree to my conditions, I won’t accept your challenge,”
said Horikita. In all likelihood, the ultimatum was meant as a way to
hamstring Nagumo.
“So I can’t win by attacking Horikita-senpai’s pawns, huh? Fine.” I’d
expected him to object, but surprisingly, Nagumo agreed readily enough.
However, Horikita’s brother wasn’t finished.
“This isn’t limited to my group. I refuse to acknowledge any methods
that cause harm to spill over to other students either. Our competition is
invalid the moment I determine you’ve been meddling in others’ affairs.”
“Just as I’d expect, senpai. You miss nothing. I’d considered recruiting
other groups to launch a joint attack, but…” Nagumo smiled audaciously.
“Well, since I’m the only one who really wants to compete, I don’t mind
agreeing to a certain number of conditions. All right. Fair and square, let’s
see who scores higher and works better as a group or whatever. Ah, let me
say this, though—no need to penalize the loser, yeah? After all, our pride is
what’s on the line here.”
Horikita’s brother said nothing to either confirm or deny that. That
probably meant he didn’t even intend to put his pride on the line for this.
51

WITH THAT, the long opening act was finally at an end. But then
Nagumo called out to our small group, stopping us in our tracks.
“Hey. Now that the seniors are gone, it looks like you guys haven’t
decided on a representative yet.”
“Huh? How could you tell?” asked Keisei, sounding slightly panicked.
“When I suggested everyone play rock-paper-scissors, it took a minute
before you stumbled out. If you’d had a representative picked, he’d have
stepped forward right away. I noticed one other group had a delayed reaction
too. I’m thinking the groups that couldn’t decide on their representatives
were probably the ones with a more balanced mix of three or four classes,”
said Nagumo.
Nagumo probably didn’t know each and every one of the first-year
students. Even so, he had correctly deduced how our groups were divided,
which wasn’t something just anyone could do. Any delays on our part had
been minor. We hadn’t discussed it; I’d just shoved Keisei and he’d
immediately stepped up. Most people would never have noticed anything
wrong.
I’d been trying to avoid exposing what could be construed as a
weakness in our group. I guess my attempt had been in vain.
“I thought the school didn’t mind if we decide on a representative
later.”
“That’s right. But we want to know who the first-year representatives
are. I want everyone to be aware that it’s better to select a representative early
on. The later someone assumes that role, the more time they have to spend
playing catch-up.”
I wasn’t sure how accurate that was, but Nagumo’s meaning was clear.
He wanted us to select our representative now.
“…What do we do?” asked Keisei, directing his question to the group.
Other than me, he wasn’t very familiar with its members and probably didn’t
52
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
want to be pushed into the role.
“However you decide is fine. Pick a representative now.”
If the student council president was giving us a direct order, then even
ostensible delinquents like Ishizaki and Albert couldn’t object.
“No one’s gonna volunteer for this. How about we go with rock-paper-
scissors again?” said Ishizaki, balling up his fist. I agreed.
The nine of us formed a circle. Nine fists. That meant we were short
one person.
“Hey, Kouenji,” said Keisei. Kouenji was looking out a window and
didn’t even bother acknowledging us.
“Blondie. Hurry it up,” said someone from the second-years, their
voice containing a hint of anger. Kouenji finally turned around—and said
nothing about rock-paper-scissors. Only his hair.
“Heh. You find my hair to be a truly exquisite shade, do you not?”
“What?”
“Kouenji, get serious.”
“About what? Is a game of rock-paper-scissors what you’d call
serious?”
“Hey, first-year. Kouenji, right? Are you mocking us seniors?”
As expected, Kouenji was already drawing attention to himself.
“Mocking you? I am not mocking anyone. I have absolutely no interest
in you at all.” He might have intended to convey that he wasn’t mocking
them, but of course, this had the exact opposite effect. “I will not participate
in rock-paper-scissors. I have no interest in being representative.”
“I’m not interested in being representative either. Neither is anyone
else. But this is the only option,” said Keisei exasperatedly. But Kouenji
showed no sign of complying.
“You say bizarre things, boy. If you don’t want to do something, then
there’s no reason to participate. Don’t you agree?”
“No. Those are the rules.”
“The rule is that someone from the group must become the
53
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
representative. In that case, someone other than me will do it.”
“Stop screwing around. Being selfish ain’t gonna fly here,” snapped
Ishizaki, who once had fought with Kouenji, together with Ryuuen.
“Heh. In that case, why not go ahead and make me the group
representative?” said Kouenji, brushing his bangs aside. Ishizaki froze.
“Then you’ll be the leader. You’re okay with that?”
“You are free to push that job onto me. I have no intention of objecting
to each and every little thing. If we have no representative, then the group
will be punished, yes? If you’re afraid of that, I’m fine with this option,” said
Kouenji.
However, what he said next left everyone dumbfounded.
“I will do whatever I want to do. If I don’t want to do something, then I
absolutely will not do it. This means I won’t be fulfilling the duties of the
representative. It doesn’t matter who seeks to consult me; my resolve will not
waver. I may even boycott the exam. Even if that results in our scores
dropping below average. Even if that results in someone being expelled.
Okay?”
“That’s… If you do all that, you’ll get expelled too!”
“Heh heh. Yes, I suppose so.”
It was like he didn’t fear expulsion at all.
“However, this talk is really just silly. Even if I do get a zero on the
exam, our average score is unlikely to drop to dangerous levels as long as the
rest of you put forward your best efforts,” said Kouenji, combing his hair.
But there was no guarantee that was true. It was just Kouenji’s self-
serving interpretation that the exam wouldn’t be that difficult. Or perhaps he
just wasn’t thinking it through, because he just didn’t care. In any case, his
brand of uniqueness had been thoroughly proven for all to see.
“Talk about a weirdo. He must have a few screws loose,” muttered
Ishizaki, taking a step back and nodding.
However, I’d noticed a contradiction in Kouenji’s words. Ishizaki and
the others probably didn’t see it, because there were no falsehoods in what
Kouenji was saying and doing. Which meant that if he’d intentionally created
54
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
that contradiction, then…
To find out for sure, I’d have to risk waiting until exam day.
“Well whatever. He probably doesn’t have the guts to get a zero or
anything. Just make him be the rep.”
Ishizaki wanted to force the troublesome and risky role of
representative on Kouenji if he could. Looking at it from another class’s
perspective, this meant losing the chance to earn double points. There was
also the possibility of someone getting dragged down via the solidarity rule.
But if Kouenji really did boycott the exam, the consequences would be dire…
“Knock it off, Ishizaki. If you keep that up, you’ll be the one getting
dragged down,” said Hashimoto.
“But… Damn it. All right, fine, if you can get whatever you want by
being a stubborn asshole, then I definitely ain’t bein’ representative either.”
“All right,” said Hashimoto, nodding in exasperated acceptance.
Nobody thought that our group would take first place, evidenced by the
fact that no one wanted the role of representative. This might prove to be
more difficult than I’d imagined. If Kouenji continued to act like, well,
himself, we’d lose a considerable number of points. He was the chaotic
element the second- and third-year students hadn’t factored into their
calculations.
But then someone stepped forward and interrupted our conversation to
comment on Kouenji’s bizarre behavior.
“Even I’ve heard rumors about you, Kouenji.”
Nagumo, who’d never have a reason to interact with Kouenji under
normal circumstances, approached him as though he had found something of
great interest. Well, this was unexpected.
“I know about you too. You’re the new student council president, are
you not?” asked Kouenji, brazen as always.
“Act the fool as much as you like, but do you really not care about
being expelled?” asked Nagumo. “The way this school’s set up is a pain, but
despite that aimless attitude of yours, you’ve gotten this far. It must be ’cause
you do want to graduate from here. But you’re fine with having the role of
representative foisted on you? And you say you’ll boycott the exam? Bullshit.
55
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
You just don’t want to put in the effort to reach Class A. But you don’t want
to be expelled either.”
“Heh heh. You say some rather amusing things. How can you be so
sure of my ‘bullshit’?”
I was with Nagumo on this, though. Shortly after Kouenji had enrolled
here, he’d been asked whether he had any intention of trying for Class A. He
said he wasn’t interested. That he only wanted to graduate.
He didn’t want to get expelled, but he didn’t want to climb the ranks
either. Much the same as what I was hoping to get out of this school. Even if
he held back on the exams, he’d be fine. That’s why he was so self-assured.
“It’s written all over your face,” said Nagumo teasingly.
Kouenji laughed cheerfully. “Bravo, bravo.” He applauded. Clap.
Clap.
Then he answered honestly, almost as if delivering a confession.
“I lied because I don’t want to be the representative. Please allow me to
set the record straight. I have no desire to aim for Class A, but neither do I
have any intention of getting expelled. In light of both those desires, I think
an aimless attitude is perfectly acceptable,” said Kouenji.
Nagumo apparently wasn’t ready to accept that. “You have no interest
in Class A, huh? That’s a lie too.”
“My, oh, my. Have I already been branded as a liar?”
“If you’re not lying, then I’m curious about something, Kouenji. As of
now, do you have a surefire way of graduating from Class A?” asked
Nagumo abruptly.
Everyone was shocked.
“Oh? You do say some rather interesting things. Please, dazzle me
with your logic.”
“You sure? If I explain the logic, then that surefire plan of yours will
become unusable. No. I’ll make it unusable. Understand?”
“Heh. I don’t mind. I want to know whether or not you have any idea
what you’re talking about.” Rather than act frightened, Kouenji smiled.
“You plan to be promoted to Class A by using twenty million points,”
56
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Nagumo said. “It’s a strategy everyone’s considered at least once, but of
course, it’s not easy to accumulate that many points. Not impossible either,
though. Right after you enrolled here, you looked into what happens to third-
year students’ remaining points when they graduate.”
“Keep going.”
“Upon graduation, private points are ‘cashed in,’ meaning they can be
used even outside of the school. Their cash value in the outside world is
naturally less than the equivalent on campus, but it’s still quite an
extraordinary system. You intend to buy private points from third-years by
paying them more money than they could earn by cashing them in. Right?”
Everyone looked understandably thrown for a loop, unable to hide their
shock.
Kouenji, hearing his strategy explained to him, gave a satisfied nod.
“Precisely. I came to that conclusion shortly after enrolling here. No
matter how far I plummet during my time here, if I can obtain private points
through legal means, I can graduate from Class A. Ever since then, school
has become boring to me.”
A miraculous gambit, and one available to him precisely because he
was rich. Buying private points from students who’d given up on Class A, or
from those whose victory was already secured, or from students close to
graduation… It wouldn’t surprise me if many students opted to take such a
deal in exchange for guaranteed cash.
That said…buying points for the same price they’d net if cashed in,
alone, would be twenty million yen. Not the kind of funds a high school
student could reasonably be expected to have access to. Would people even
believe him if he said he was good for it?
“Fortunately,” Kouenji continued, “before I enrolled here, I had my
picture and profile posted on the company website, proving I’m next in line
to be president. I have tens of millions of yen at my disposal. It was easy to
convince people to trust me.”
“Yeah. I’m aware some second-years are planning to sell their points to
you, and I bet a fair number of third-years are, too. You’ve gotten people to
keep mum about it, but more than a few second-years have put their absolute
trust in me. Some of them consulted me, asking if they should take you at
57
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
your word. Of course, I said it was all right. It’s not without risk, but you
seem to be a fairly rich guy.”
Nagumo looked over the assembled second- and third-years.
“However, that ends today,” he said. “Even if he really is rich, Kouenji
isn’t a man you can trust. As you just saw, he lies without batting an eye. It’s
best not to do business with him, even by mistake. Oh, and by the way, I
intend to raise this issue with the school. Purchasing private points prior to
graduation shouldn’t be allowed in the first place, after all.”
“That’s fine by me. I’ve merely been making plans to move up to Class
A. I hadn’t decided if I was going to carry it out.”
Kouenji seems to have envisioned this as but one strategy of many.
What an outrageous idea. Well, truth be told, it was just the one-of-a-kind
strategy that only a rich kid like Kouenji could pull off.
“I thought you were weird, but you came up with that strategy all on
your own, huh? Impressive,” muttered Hashimoto, sounding both impressed
and exasperated.
“What’s Kouenji planning to do by abandoning his own strategy then?”
Several gazes fell upon Kouenji’s classmates: Keisei and me. We had
no idea…though one thing came to mind. A rich kid like Kouenji didn’t need
to graduate from Class A. Even if he hit upon a way to make it to Class A, he
didn’t need to actually implement his idea. If his only goal was to graduate—
irrespective of class—then making allies and cooperating with other students
would be rather pointless.
It would explain why he didn’t care if Nagumo blew the lid on his
plans. Maybe he’d even enjoy coming up with another strategy. Nagumo’s
insight into Kouenji’s affairs was quite remarkable.
“This was the first time I’ve ever seen Kouenji get busted,” muttered
Keisei. I had to agree.
And yet…
“However, Student Council President, this only proves I have no real
reason to play rock-paper-scissors for the position of representative. Now that
my plans have been revealed, I can simply say I have no intention of taking
on the role.”
58
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“I see.”
Whatever tricks Kouenji might still have up his sleeve, his stance
hadn’t changed. On the contrary, he had exposed his own lie—which was
also his only vulnerability—and tossed it out himself. This left us with no
way to force the role of representative on him against his will. Someone with
his degree of wealth and privilege had no reason to fear expulsion; I couldn’t
imagine his future being tarnished at all by such an event. We could
hypothetically resort to drastic measures to railroad him into being the
representative, but no one in our group dared try something of the sort. If we
lost, he might take one of us down with him.
“I guess I should do it,” said Keisei, raising his hand resignedly.
Some of the students from other classes reacted to that. But with
delinquents like Kouenji, Ishizaki, and Albert in the group, and because we
had little chance of winning, no one challenged Keisei for the nomination.
“It’s settled.”
Nagumo dismissed the group, and we left the gymnasium as instructed.
59
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com

“THIS SEEMS…a lot older than I thought it would be.”
The small groups were shown to their dorm rooms, each of which had
wooden bunk beds matching the number of people in the group. Ishizaki
immediately walked to the bed at the back of the room and climbed to the top
bunk.
“This one’s mine.”
“What are you talking about? You can’t just stroll up and take what
you like. That’s not fair,” snapped Yahiko.
“You know what they say. The early bird gets the worm,” said
Ishizaki. He snorted and lay down, sneering at Yahiko.
“We should discuss who gets which bed.”
Keisei, our representative, tried to rein in the situation. Ishizaki
probably meant to defy him just as he had
Yahiko, but I was standing right next to Keisei, and his gaze met mine
for an instant. He’d been trying to avoid making eye contact with me, but
being in the same group made that a foregone conclusion.
“Tch…”
For a moment, Ishizaki looked terrified. He hopped down off the bed.
“Okay, so. How exactly do we decide?” he asked.
Keisei tilted his head to the side, looking puzzled by Ishizaki’s sudden
change of heart. Ishizaki may have interpreted Keisei’s warning as being a
warning from me, which was frankly paranoid. Honestly, I didn’t think it was
all that strange to claim our beds on a first-come-first-served basis, really—
although naturally, coming to mutual agreement after fruitful discussion
would be more ideal.
“Heh heh. Well, I suppose I’ll go ahead and help myself,” said
Kouenji, leaping up onto the bed that Ishizaki had been occupying.
“What the hell, man?!” shouted Ishizaki.
60
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
But this was Kouenji. Common sense didn’t apply to him. He ignored
Ishizaki and relaxed into the bed; within moments, he was as at ease as if this
were his own bedroom.
“God damn it. To hell with discussion.”
After what Kouenji had done, people started to call dibs on beds.
Ishizaki gave up on arguing with Kouenji and claimed the top bunk of a
different bed. Everyone seemed united in their preference for a top bunk, save
Albert, the only heavyset person here, who settled into the bunk beneath
Ishizaki without any complaints.
The unspoken consensus seemed to be that discussion was no longer
how we were doing things.
“Guess this is the only spot I can take,” said Keisei, securing the bed
underneath Kouenji. Unsurprisingly, no one else wanted to take it. The others
might not have noticed, but it was significant that Keisei was willing to do
the things no one else wanted to do.
In the end, I settled on a bottom bunk beneath Hashimoto from Class
A.
“Nice to meet you. Um…” Hashimoto reached his hand down from the
top bunk in greeting. He didn’t seem to know my name.
“I’m Ayanokouji. Nice to meet you.”
“Hashimoto.”
We shook hands lightly, as if promising to get along.
We were now free for the rest of the day and, as such, abandoned all
pretense of group unity to just do whatever we wanted. A natural-born leader
like Hirata might have tried to get us talking, but…
As for me, my feelings were fixed. While it was unfortunate that I
wasn’t getting to know any students from other classes better, it was also a
relief to not have to deal with annoying small talk.
“This might be a stupid question, but can Albert speak Japanese? He
understands Japanese, right?” Hashimoto lay on his top bunk, directing the
question to Ishizaki and Albert.
“Of course he does. Right, Albert?” answered Ishizaki, peering down
61
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
at his friend. However, Albert just continued to stare straight ahead in silence.
“Or maybe he doesn’t.”
“Aren’t you guys classmates?” Hashimoto laughed.
“I don’t know, all right? Ryuuen-san’s normally the one giving
orders,” replied an irritated Ishizaki.
“Ryuuen-san, huh?”
Ishizaki’s respectful—and contradictory—use of the honorific was
interesting.
“Is it true you guys had a fight and ousted him as leader?”
“God, shut up. Of course it is. Calling him ‘san’ was just…old habits,
that’s all.”
Rather than come together as a group, we were already sniping at each
other. I decided to escape the escalating conflict and take a walk around the
building.

FINALLY, IT WAS mealtime. The first time we’d seen the girls since
getting off the bus that morning.
The cafeteria was quite spacious, so much so that it even had stairs to a
second floor with a view of the first. From what I saw, this place could
apparently fit about five hundred people. And it was currently packed.
“It’s not easy to meet up with someone when we don’t have our
phones.”
Horikita and Kei were probably looking for me, but I didn’t set out to
search for them. If they did happen to run into me, their reactions would
probably be polar opposites. Horikita would probably snap at me for avoiding
her, while Kei would wait and see what happened, understanding that since I
hadn’t sought her out, there was no reason for us to make contact right now.
Touching base with various students on the first day was to be
expected. I doubted many people had eyes on me, but it was quite possible
that Sakayanagi and Nagumo were watching. Even though I could say that
Hirata and Satou had only been hanging out with us over Christmas, Nagumo
understood that I had a special relationship with Kei.
I wanted to avoid conspicuous contact.
I stayed solo, observing who was hanging out with who. But first, it
was time to eat. The strict allotted hour was precious. I carried my tray over
to my seat and sat down alone. Back at school, students would be separated
by grade level to a certain extent, but here, first-, second- and third-years
mixed together.
Many of the small and large groups stuck together, but there were more
than few students scouting for information. More importantly, this was the
only place and time we got to see the girls, making it the only time couples
could spend together.
“Siiiigh.”
I heard a cute, exhausted sigh be released near me. It belonged to first-
63
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
year Class B’s leader, Ichinose Honami. A bunch of guys and girls were
crowded around her. I decided to sit nearby and listen in on their
conversation, confident I’d remain relatively unnoticed.
“…Pathetic to be proud of taking up so little space,” I muttered.
Ichinose and the others didn’t react to me at all. Well, the cafeteria was
crowded. They couldn’t pay close attention to every single student.
“Good work, Honami-chan. Was it tough?”
“Ah ha ha. Well, I suppose it was, yeah. I thought deciding on a group
wouldn’t be so bad. But when people wanna fight, they’re gonna fight.”
“Nothing we can do about that. The other classes are enemies.”
“But according to Kanzaki-kun, the boys came to a decision pretty
quickly.”
“Huh? Really? It took us until past noon.”
The boys hadn’t had an easy time of it, but it sounded like the girls had
struggled even more than we had. Maybe the instructors had anticipated that,
which explained why there weren’t any classes on the first day.
“Do you think someone might get expelled?”
“Well, I can’t say there’s no reason to worry. Even though no one’s
been expelled from the first-year classes, we can’t let our guard down.” It
seemed Ichinose was acutely aware of the danger.
“What should we do if someone gets taken down by the solidarity
rule?”
“It’ll be okay, Mako-chan. As long as we take this seriously, it’s not
going to come to that.”
“Are you sure?”
“If that time does come, we’ll all help each other out,” said Ichinose
gently. Though she looked the most exhausted of them all, she remained
stout-hearted as ever. “Ahh… I’m beat.”
She laid her head on the table. Unfortunately, that change of position
allowed her to notice me.

“Ayanokouji-kuuun!”
Oh, hey, Ichinose. Didn’t notice you there. If I said that, it’d come off
as unnatural. It was probably best to just answer honestly.
“Sounds like you were having fun.”
“Some girls find power in gossip,” said Ichinose, flopping over once
again.
I didn’t really understand what she meant. This listlessness was kind of
surprising, coming from her.
“I suppose I probably shouldn’t do that, huh?” said Ichinose, sitting
back up straight. I stopped her.
“It’s normal to do something like that when you’re exhausted,” I said.
“Sorry for making you kind of uncomfortable.”
I wasn’t uncomfortable at all, but I couldn’t speak those words aloud.
“Sounds like you got put in a tough group,” I said instead.
“I guess you could say it’s been tough just getting the groups
together… Like, girls are really up-front about their likes and dislikes. Or
rather, there are more than a few girls who are willing to just tell another girl
they don’t like her to her face. I suppose guys tend to keep their personal
feelings on the down-low, huh?”
“They’re pretty up-front about hating Ryuuen, though.”
“I feel bad for laughing at that, but I guess there’s no helping it. Still,
isn’t Ryuuen-kun tired of it too? Being disliked by everyone has to be
draining.”
She wasn’t wrong, but the logic probably didn’t apply to Ryuuen. If
anything, he seemed to be taking it pretty easy now that he was no longer
shouldering the burdens of an entire class.
“Don’t work yourself too hard.” Concluding that it would be pointless
to linger, I stood up.
“I’m okay, I’m okay. My energy’s the only thing I have going for me.
See you later, Ayanokouji-kun.” Ichinose waved gently in farewell.
One hour per day. That was the only time we’d have to talk to the girls.
66
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Even though boys and girls couldn’t directly intervene in each other’s affairs,
I imagined this hour was designed for sharing information. The school likely
intended us to use the time to gather information, strategize, and continue to
fight, making it an area where well-liked and well-trusted students with
strong communication skills excelled.
“I’m not suited to this at all.”
Just like on the deserted island, there was basically nothing I could do
to help.

Chapter 3:
Human Nature Put to the Test
 
IT WAS PAST SIX in the morning when lighthearted music began to
reverberate throughout the room from speakers, clearly a signal for us to get
out of bed. The room was still dark. I couldn’t even see sunlight through the
thin curtains.
“The hell? God, shut up.”
Ishizaki’s grumblings were the first words that we heard. Some
students lay in bed even after hearing the music, but most of us slowly started
to rouse, sitting up in bed, putting on our glasses, and so on.
“I guess we’re getting started,” Hashimoto muttered with a sigh.
“For the time being, it’d be best if we all get up. If even one of us is
absent, we’ll get hit with a deduction,” said Keisei, putting on his jersey. As
long as we shared a room, collective responsibility was unavoidable.
“Hey, Kouenji’s not here.”
“Good morning, gentlemen. Were you about to search for me?” said
Kouenji, entering the room covered with a thin layer of sweat, wearing a
pleasant smile. Apparently, he’d gotten up even before we did.
“Doesn’t seem like you went to the bathroom or anything.”
“Heh. It was such a nice morning, I went ahead and did my training.”
“What training? There’s no telling what we’re facing today. I can’t
approve of you pointlessly exhausting your stamina,” said Keisei. Not that
Kouenji was listening. On the contrary, he offered a gleeful rebuttal.
“Even after a full session of training, I have unimaginable reserves of
stamina to spare. This is nothing, really. Besides, if you are so worried about
stamina, shouldn’t you have warned the group yesterday?”
“I didn’t…think there’d be any kind of training happening.”
“No, no. I’m afraid that’s not going to cut it. I remember sharing a
room with you back on the cruise ship. Surely you recall that I am the sort of
68
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
man who never skips out on training,” spat Kouenji, as if it were outrageous
Keisei would forget such a thing.
“Enough with the high-and-mighty act, Kouenji,” said Ishizaki. He
wasn’t trying to defend Keisei—everyone was just fed up with Kouenji,
who’d been behaving selfishly from square one. He was probably used to
being a disruptive element.
We didn’t have time for this now. The thing I most wanted to avoid
was being late on the first day. Someone like Hirata would have gotten the
group in order, but without a clear leader…
“Enough already. Promise us you’ll cooperate.”
“What do you mean, ‘promise’? Have you sworn allegiance to this
randomly selected group? I don’t see it that way.”
“Well I don’t wanna cooperate, either,” said Ishizaki, scanning the
room and unintentionally settling his gaze on me.
“Because of Class A? Is that the reason why you hate this?” asked
Hashimoto, coming down from the top bunk to stand next to me. Ishizaki’s
gaze settled on him.
“Tch. It ain’t just ’cause of A. It’s everyone,” said Ishizaki. He turned
back to Kouenji.
“You seem to be heading down the same delinquent path as Red-Hair-
kun,” Kouenji said. “It’s been amusing to watch, but now that I’ve dealt with
you directly, I’ve frankly had my fill. Shouldn’t you hurry along to the
meeting place? Leave before your incompetence is exposed.”
The fact that the only person here who grasped what was happening
was Kouenji just added fuel to the fire. He was choosing his words to agitate
Ishizaki, and it was working.
“All right, bring it on! Yaaaah!” shouted Ishizaki.
Keisei checked the clock as Kouenji mentioned time and started
panicking. “We don’t even have five minutes until assembly. Leave the
fighting for later.”
“Ain’t my problem. If we’re late, it’s his fault!”
It looked like no amount of water could douse the fires of Ishizaki’s
69
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
anger now. On the contrary, the flames were just growing hotter. Keisei could
see what was happening, but he didn’t know how to manage their feelings in
a way that would let him wrap this up.
“You’ve got a one-track mind. That’s probably why you got demoted
to Class D,” Yahiko commented, only adding more fuel to the fire. The Class
B students just watched, waiting for the situation to blow over.
“This is pitiful. I don’t know whether we’ll make it with these clowns.”
Hashimoto sighed. “Well, guess there’s no helping it.”
The way he said it made me think he was washing his hands of the
matter, but then he punched the wood of his bed frame with his balled fist.
Everyone except Kouenji reacted to the sound.
“Just calm down, you lot. It’s fine to duke it out, but this is the worst
possible time and place. Get it? If our furniture gets banged up, we’ll be held
responsible. And if someone’s face gets bruised, we’ll be in trouble for it.
Right?”
Having cut through the silence with a sound other than his voice,
Hashimoto said what needed to be said. Ishizaki, who had been hollering
about how our problems didn’t concern him, had to understand now that he
was putting even himself in jeopardy.
“Hey, Four Eyes-kun. What’s your name again?”
“Yukimura.”
“That’s right. It’s just like Yukimura-kun said. There’s no time. So
how about you bury that anger deep, deep down, and we go to assembly? If
you’re still mad after breakfast, you can decide if you want to beat each other
up. That’s what being a group is about, right?”
“You should be happy, Kouenji. You get to live a little longer.”
“Oh, my, yes. I happen to be a pacifist,” said Kouenji.
Just what you’d expect from Class A, huh? I didn’t know exactly
where Hashimoto fit in the class hierarchy, but he’d expertly solved this
problem for us. The fire was still burning, but it was contained for now. We
left the room, still cradling a bomb with a lit fuse.
The boys from all three grade levels gathered in one classroom.
Approximately forty people, give or take. You could almost say it was like
70
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
we made one class. The first-year students all extended brief morning
greetings to the second- and third-years. Not too long afterward, the teacher
entered the room.
“I’m Onodera, the instructor in charge of third-year Class B. We’re
going to take roll call now, and then you will go outside and clean your
designated areas. After that, you will clean the school building. These
cleaning duties will be part of your morning routine for the next week. In the
event that it rains, you will be exempt from working outside but not let off
work; you’ll just spend twice as much time cleaning indoors instead. As for
your lessons—they won’t just be taught by school instructors. There will be
individuals coming in to cover a variety of different topics. Please give them
a proper welcome and behave yourselves.”
With that brief explanation, our group went off to clean.
71

THE SCENT OF SOFT RUSH from the tatami mats tickled my nostrils. The
space before me made me feel strangely nostalgic. The teacher had escorted
us to a spacious dojo, where it seemed we’d be working alongside some other
groups.
“Starting today, you will practice zazen here in the mornings and
evenings.”
“Zazen? I myself have never before engaged in such an activity,” said
the Professor from the other side of the dojo.
The man in charge, hearing this comment, approached the Professor.
“Wh-whatever do you want with one such as I?” asked the Professor,
looking up at the man. He looked unnerved by the silent, almost intimidating
aura the man radiated.
“The way you speak. Is that something you were born with? Or is it a
hometown dialect?” asked the man.
“Mayhap I would say that is not the case…”
“You’re not a time traveler from the Muromachi Period or the Edo
Period, are you?” asked the man.
“Huh? No, of course, I myself have never engaged in the luxury of
time travel…”
“I see. I don’t quite understand what you think you’re achieving by
talking like that, but here’s some advice. Fix that ridiculous speech pattern
and grow up.”
“Wh-what?”
“What would someone think of you if you spoke that way to them
upon your first meeting? Do you need me to elaborate?”
I didn’t know why the Professor chose to speak that way, but even I
could tell it was a deliberate affectation. He certainly wouldn’t be permitted
to speak that way in the real world, or at the very least, in a formal setting.
72
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
There were no rules against it, of course, but it went against socially accepted
codes of morals and manners. You could dig in your heels and defend it as a
personal quirk, but very, very few people could successfully get away with
that.
“All right, listen up, and listen well. There are people out there who
sling their words and actions around without consideration for others in an
attempt to stand out. To show that they’re special. This is true not only for the
young, but also for the elderly too,” our instructor said sternly. “You don’t
need to change your personality to be a part of society. You’re free to express
your individuality, of course, but you must take other people’s feelings into
consideration as you venture out into the world. These lessons will help you
cultivate that mentality, using techniques such as zazen. By bringing your
words and movements to a halt, you will be unified with the people around
you, merging with the group. Consider others, and finally, think. What kind
of person am I? What can I do?”
He deliberately directed his gaze over toward the Professor, as if to
say, ‘Get it now?’
“I-I have felt fe—ack, gotta be careful.”
He might not be able to get rid of his speech pattern right away, but
practicing zazen might teach the Professor to look inward—for instance, at
why he’d slipped just then.
The groups were seated individually and then given a brief
explanation. This room was called the zazen dojo. While in here, we were to
ball either our right or left hand into a fist and wrap the other hand around it.
We had to keep it that way whether walking or standing. Also, we needed to
keep it at the height of our solar plexus. That was a stance known as shashu.
Depending on which sect you were in, there were different rules about how to
form your hands.
We received an explanation on one more thing regarding zazen.
Simply, it was nothing more than one form of meditation. Practicing zazen
wasn’t about emptying your head but about forming an image. There was
also something known as Ten Bulls, a series of poems and accompanying
pictures that illustrated the path toward enlightenment.
I was new to this zazen stuff, myself.
73
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“After you’ve crossed your legs, place your feet on your thighs.
Practice a lot, because sitting in the lotus position will have an effect on your
exam results.”
“Ow. Wait, for real? I can’t even get one leg up.”
“If you are unable to do it at the start, you may instead use half-lotus
position, with just one leg crossed.”
The man in charge demonstrated the pose. I was able to cross my legs
without any problem, so I decided to go with the lotus position. Surprisingly,
it seemed a lot of students couldn’t do it…though Kouenji, who was starting
to intrigue me, had his legs crossed effortlessly. He wore a faint smile,
looking as though he’d already entered a state of zen.
Since his posture needed no correction, the man in charge moved past
him without complaint.
“He can really do it, huh,” said Tokitou in a hushed voice. He was also
able to pull off the lotus position.
“He doesn’t appear to dislike this kind of thing. That’s a relief.”
“Yeah.”
Our instructor was a scary-looking guy, but this was Kouenji, after all.
He might have simply refused to do the lesson.
Now that all of the students had grasped the general idea, zazen time
began. However, since we’d spent quite a bit of time having things explained
to us, our first session was limited to just five minutes.

AFTER MORNING CLEANING and zazen, it was around seven o’clock—
breakfast time. But we were led outside instead of into the large cafeteria
we’d used yesterday evening. There, we found a spacious eating area
prepared for us. Several groups had already arrived.
“The school will provide a meal for you today, but starting tomorrow,
provided that the weather is clear, you will be making breakfast with your
group. You must discuss how you wish to divide the work with your whole
group.”
“For real? I ain’t ever cooked a meal before,” grumbled Ishizaki.
But if that was the rule, then there was no avoiding it. Preparations for
breakfast were underway while we received instructions on how to prepare
food from tomorrow onward. It looked as though the breakfast menu had
already been set, and handouts on how to prepare the items were being
distributed. At least we’d know what to cook.
“Ugh, is this all there is?”
The meal was simple. A Japanese breakfast, consisting of soup, rice,
and three other dishes. For students with hearty appetites, this wasn’t going to
be enough. While it seemed we could choose to swap in other dishes, we’d
need to prepare everything ourselves.
“Thank goodness for that island test. Compared to that, this is luxury,”
said Keisei, sounding somehow relieved, as he began eating.
“If we’re going to do this fairly, let’s have each grade level take turns
at cooking,” said a third-year boy who appeared to be a representative,
addressing his mealtime rotation proposal to Nagumo.
“Yeah. I’ve got no objections. I’d like to start with the first-years.”
“How about it, first-years? Any objections?”
There was no way anyone could object. Assuming we had clear
weather for the remainder of our time, we’d be making breakfast six times.
The order in which we’d be cooking would be different, but that wasn’t
75
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
reason enough to complain. I wouldn’t say it was unquestionably the kind of
thing underclassmen should knuckle under and accept, but I was fine with it.
“We accept,” said Keisei.
“Since we’ll be cooking breakfast, what time should we wake up
tomorrow?”
“To make sure we have enough time, let’s wake two hours early,”
proposed Keisei.
Ishizaki vigorously rejected the idea. Keisei’s proposal meant he’d
have to be up and ready to go by 4:00 a.m.
“Still, we don’t have any choice. If we can’t prepare breakfast, it’ll be
awful.”
“Then you guys do it. I’ll be sleeping.”
Ishizaki had never made such statements while under Ryuuen. But in
this group, he’d already risen to the top of the hierarchy. It was interesting
how his behavior had changed when his status did. Being celebrated as one of
the distinguished few who had overthrown Ryuuen probably had something
to do with it.
I couldn’t really blame him for being standoffish with me, given I
knew what had really happened. Also, being placed in the same group as me
must have shaken him. His actions and words weren’t just hurting other
people; they were hurting him too.
Ishizaki and Albert weren’t cut out to be leaders or strategists. They
were more suited to be third in command., the ones corralling the rest of the
students. Ryuuen should have made sure they kept those roles—though, to be
honest, Keisei and Yahiko were similar. They weren’t as foolhardy as
Ishizaki, but they weren’t qualified to be leaders, either.
I would’ve thought Class B would take a more active role, but they’d
been unusually quiet so far. Maybe they weren’t as proactive as I thought,
with the exception of certain individuals like Kanzaki and Shibata.
That made Hashimoto the person most qualified to hold the group
together. His prestigious Class A position, together with his ability to assess
situations clearly and communicate effectively, were all key. However, he
didn’t seem willing to lead.
76

AFTER OUR PLAIN—no, our healthy morning meal— the real lessons
began. Our large group gathered in a classroom that was a bit more spacious
than those in the Advanced Nurturing High School. I wondered if it was
supposed to resemble a college classroom.
There was no assigned seating, so it was inevitable that students from
the same grade level would cluster in small groups. You could sit in the
corner by yourself, but that might gain you unwanted attention from other
grade levels. You might even get a warning. Since the second- and third-year
small groups hadn’t arrived yet, we first-years had our pick of seats.
“Would it be better to sit up front?”
“No, we should probably wait before taking out seats. Shouldn’t the
seniors take their seats first, and then we grab whatever’s available?”
Keisei didn’t want to run the risk of getting chewed out.
“Don’t go being selfish again, Kouenji. You might end up sitting off by
yourself.”
“If we’re free to choose our seats, I believe I shall sit wherever I
please.”
Despite saying that, Kouenji showed no sign of sitting down. So he
wasn’t entirely an agent of chaos after all. He did actually listen quietly
during our normal lessons too. The man just lived by his own rules.
“Seems like you first-years are struggling a bit,” said a second-year
student. “Need any help?”
“We’re okay,” replied Keisei, lightly bowing in response. “Ugh. Why
do I have to be the representative?” he muttered.
After all, communicating with the second- and third-year students was
the representative’s responsibility. Keisei seemed to be under a large amount
of stress. If I left him hanging like this, it would only be a matter of time
before he exploded.
77
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
3.4
 
IN THE AFTERNOON, we had PE—or rather basic physical fitness
conditioning. We were told the main focus would be marathon training, and
that a long-distance relay race was scheduled for the last day, undoubtedly
part of the final exam. We’d practice outside for a few days, and then later on
the track.
“Huff huff,” panted Keisei.
The many tasks we’d already completed since morning had depleted
our stamina, and he was struggling. I could have helped him with a
knowledge-oriented problem, but when it came to physical fitness, there was
nothing I could do but watch.
Surprisingly, Ishizaki and Albert had more stamina than the average
student. They made it through practice easily, perhaps because, delinquents
though they were, they didn’t smoke.
“All I’ve done since morning is analyze things.”
For whatever reason, I was growing tired of this. Putting aside the
question of whether I intended to play an active role, I’d come to the
realization that I wanted to improve our group’s performance enough to keep
us safe from expulsion. If we came in last place and scored beneath the
minimum threshold set by the school, then Keisei would be expelled.
The likelihood of him taking me down with him was almost
infinitesimally low but not zero. If we lost, he might resent me for not
offering a helping hand despite seeing him struggle. Should I provide the bare
minimum of assistance necessary to save him? Or should I work to put the
group on the right track? Maybe I should just observe everything and hope
that the problem resolved itself? No—I quickly eliminated that last option.
Kouenji’s presence would be a cause for concern too. I should
probably make a move sooner rather than later.
I slowed down in order to run alongside Kouenji, who was jogging
nonchalantly. Even as I approached, he didn’t even glance at me. He
wouldn’t leave his own private world unless I forced him to.
78
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Hey, Kouenji. Can’t you go a little easier on them all?”
“By them, you are referring to the group, Ayanokouji Boy?”
“Yeah. They’re confused. Not everyone is as incredible as you.”
“Ha ha ha, I certainly am one of a kind. However, wouldn’t it be the
absolute height of stupidity to hold myself back in order to keep pace with
common riffraff?”
“Well…I don’t know if that’s right. But…”
“What are you trying to say?”
“It would be nice if the group could score reasonably well. I’d like to
avoid expulsion.”
“If that’s what you want, then you must work hard to make it happen,
hmm?”
“I’m saying this to you because I intend to work hard.”
Kouenji didn’t respond, leaving our pounding feet as the only sound
we heard. He’d gone right back into his own little world. Guess talking to
him was a wasted effort after all.
Half-assed threats or pleas were meaningless when it came to Kouenji.
Reflecting on everything that had happened so far told me that much. It
didn’t matter if the class joined forces to plead with him or if the teachers put
their weight behind us—if he didn’t want to do something, that was that. He
was an obstinate, utterly self-involved person.
79
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com

PERHAPS BECAUSE it was our first day of classes, or because our
marathon training had been so demanding, the rest of the lessons consisted
solely of explanations for what to expect this week. It was, however, made
clear to us that the primary goal of these lessons was to teach us socialization
skills.
Of course, the first-years had no idea what that meant. The second-
years, on the other hand, seemed to take it calmly in stride. The experience
gap between us was impossible to ignore.
“Ugh.”
Our final lesson for the afternoon, zazen, had ended. Keisei collapsed,
unable to move.
“Are you okay?”
“I’d like to say I am, but my legs feel all numb. Please…give me a
minute.”
Looked like the lesson had been unexpectedly hard on Keisei. He
remained stiff and motionless for about two minutes, waiting until the
numbness in his legs subsided. Ishizaki hadn’t done so well with zazen either.
He bent forward in agony.
“Damn. Okay, food and bath. Yeah, bath. Give me a hand, Albert.”
Albert approached Ishizaki, grabbed his arm, and pulled him up.
“Gah! More gently! Let go!”
Thud! Ishizaki collapsed.
“Gaaah!”
I couldn’t help but be amused by watching that interaction play out.
The rest of our group, however, just found Ishizaki and those like him a pain
in the neck. Keisei moved to leave, ignoring them, but I purposefully held my
ground.
“They’re an amusing duo, huh?” I asked, deliberately drawing Keisei’s
80
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
attention.
“Kiyotaka, just leave them alone. They’re goofing around. Don’t look
at them too much or you’ll draw their attention.” Keisei moved in front of
me, blocking my view. “He might not be as bad as Sudou, but Ishizaki’s still
the type to punch first and ask questions later. This might end up being like
Ryuuen all over again.”
“Still, we’re in the same group. I’m sure they won’t mind a certain
amount of contact, right?”
I pointed. Ishizaki noticed us and glared. Keisei flinched, but Ishizaki
just left the dojo, dragging Albert with him.
“What?” I asked.
“You’re surprisingly bold, Kiyotaka.”
That was because I knew what was really going on with Ishizaki and
his posse. I wanted to find a way to indirectly tell Keisei not to worry too
much about it. As long as he was in charge of our group, he had to maintain a
certain degree of control over the students from other classes.
“Keisei, we need to peel another layer off this school.”
“A layer? What do you mean?”
“We might need to befriend Ishizaki and Albert to at least some
degree.”
“That’s ridiculous. We’re in the same group, but we’re still enemies. I
can’t befriend them.”
Like Keisei, I’d also believed there was no way rival classes could ever
get along when I first enrolled here. In fact, the school encouraged us to
compete with each other. Lately, however, I’d begun to imagine another way
forward.
“It seems Student Council President Nagumo has been able to bring
people together, irrespective of class,” I said.
“That’s…because he’s charismatic,” said Keisei. “Or he’s just special.
I don’t have that kind of talent… In fact, that’s not something anyone outside
of Class A could even do, right? We don’t know what Nagumo-senpai’s
planning, or if his methods will work all the way to graduation. But no matter
81
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
how much he unites the second-years, the ones who graduate from Class A
will have the last laugh. The rest will be left in tears.” With that, Keisei left
the dojo.

AFTER DINNER, I decided to head back to the room before the others.
There were a few people gathered in the hallway, both guys and girls, making
me think something was wrong.
“Sorry, sorry. Are you okay?”
“Yes. No need for concern.”
Yamauchi, a member of my class, reached his hand out apologetically.
It looked like he’d knocked over Sakayanagi Arisu from first-year Class A.
She didn’t take Yamauchi’s hand but instead tried to get up herself.
83
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
84
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
She couldn’t do it unaided, though, so she grabbed her cane, which lay
on the ground. Then, leaning against the wall, she slowly got back up. It
didn’t take her long, but with everyone staring at her, it probably felt like an
interminably long time to Sakayanagi.
Yamauchi awkwardly retracted his hand.
“So, uh. Guess I’ll be going?”
“Yes. Don’t mind me.”
Sakayanagi smiled lightly and looked away from Yamauchi. Everyone
began to disperse, looking relieved the issue hadn’t escalated.
“Sakayanagi-chan sure is cute, but she’s also clumsy,” muttered
Yamauchi. Apparently, it hadn’t even occurred to him she might’ve fallen
because he bumped into her.
Somehow, Sakayanagi’s gaze had found mine. “Are you okay?” I
asked her as I approached.
“Thank you ever so much for your concern. However, it’s nothing
major.”
“I’ll talk with Yamauchi later.”
“Well, he didn’t do it on purpose. I just fell, that’s all,” said
Sakayanagi with a chuckle. But her eyes weren’t laughing. “Well, then.
Please excuse me.”
Kamuro was usually by her side, but wasn’t here. She’d probably been
placed in a different group. I had no way of knowing how things were going
with the girls, and I didn’t care, either. However, as Sakayanagi started to
leave, she stopped and glanced back at me. Did she feel me staring?
“I remembered something I wanted to discuss with you, Ayanokouji-
kun.”
She tapped her cane once, a thin smile on her lips.
“Class B is quite unified. Ichinose Honami-san has earned the trust of
her comrades by giving it her all. However, what if they’re trusting her too
much?”
“That has nothing to do with me,” I replied.
85
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
But Sakayanagi continued, not caring what I said.
“There was a rumor going around about her. She’s said to possess a
tremendous number of points, despite her lack of significant achievements—
enough points to even warrant an investigation by the school, I hear. It
shouldn’t be possible for a single student to earn so many points alone. She’s
likely the treasurer for Class B. Don’t you think?”
“Who knows? Only Ichinose or her classmates could answer that
question. Why tell me this?”
“I’m saying, is it wise to entrust her with all of those private points?
For example, if she suddenly needed a large number of points to protect
herself after making some mistake, or to save a classmate, no one would
blame her for it. Perhaps she’s acting as treasurer for that purpose.”
“Probably, yeah.”
“However, if she squandered a large sum of points purely to serve her
own goals, the school might investigate on the basis of fraud.”
In any case, this wasn’t about me. This applied to no one else but
Ichinose and the students of B Class. If Ichinose really was acting as their
treasurer, then the students who had deposited their points with her would be
the ones who had the right to complain about it.
“I can’t imagine Ichinose using private points for selfish reasons,
though,” I said.
“I suppose that’s true. At the very least, no one doubts her. Yet.” In
other words, she was implying that might change. “I do so look forward to
finishing this special exam and going back to school.”
Looking satisfied, Sakayanagi turned and walked away without
looking back.

THERE WAS ABOUT one hour left until ten o’clock, which was lights-
out time. None of us really had anything to talk about, so we sat around in
our shared room in silence.
Breaking the ice was proving to be surprisingly difficult. Even if you
made an effort to initiate conversation with someone from another class, it
could easily feel forced. Ideally, someone would bring up a topic we could all
chime in on, but seemed like it might be too much to hope for.
Trying to force conversation would be off-putting. If only someone
would strike up a conversation.
A knock came at the door. Apparently we had a visitor.
“Who could that be?”
Everyone looked perplexed.
“Maybe it’s a teacher,” said Ishizaki disinterestedly.
That was certainly a possibility. Keisei got up, went to the door, and
asked who it was. The answer was surprising.
“Are you still awake?”
“Student Council President Nagumo! Is something wrong?” asked
Keisei.
“I came to check on you since we’re in the same group. Can I come
in?” asked Nagumo.
There probably wasn’t a single first-year student brave enough to
refuse him. Keisei immediately complied. Apparently, Nagumo hadn’t come
alone. Vice President Kiriyama and two other third-year students
accompanied him: Class B students named Tsunoda and Ishikura.
Once inside, Nagumo scanned the room.
“It appears all the rooms are identical, senpai,” he said to Ishikura with
a grin.
“It looks like it. Now, how exactly do you plan to deepen our bonds of
87
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
fellowship by bringing us to the first-years’ room?” asked Ishikura.
The question was directed at Nagumo, but Keisei, not understanding
what he meant, spoke up. “Bonds of fellowship?” he asked.
“I already told you, didn’t I? I came to check on you, since we’re in the
same group. We don’t have TV or computers or smartphones. There’s
nothing remotely resembling entertainment. But it’s not like we have nothing
to play with,” said Nagumo, pulling a small box from his jersey pocket.
“Cards?”
“You’re probably thinking, ‘Cards, in this day and age?’ Well, cards
are a staple game at camps like this.”
Nagumo sat down in a random spot, peeled the plastic tape from the
sealed box, and opened it.
“Take a seat, senpai. Sorry first-years, but there isn’t much space. You
stay in your beds,” said Nagumo as some of the first-years began to get up.
“I’m not playing,” said Tsunoda. He turned his back to Nagumo.
“Come on, don’t say that. Let’s play. It might help us chat a bit more
freely,” said Nagumo.
Tsunoda stopped in his tracks, seemingly giving up, and took a seat.
Ishikura sat beside him.
“We should bet something to make the game more exciting. Any
ideas?”
The first-year students, nervous in the presence of upperclassmen, said
nothing. They didn’t know how to address the student council president, and
Nagumo, of course, had anticipated they would shrink back that way.
“We decided on the order in which people will making breakfast,
right?” he said. “Let’s bet on that. If, for example, you lose constantly, you’ll
be on meal duty until the end of camp. On the other hand, if you never lose,
then you never have to cook breakfast.”
“Hey, Nagumo. Shouldn’t we discuss that with the entire group?” said
Ishikura.
“It’s only breakfast duty. Come on, give me that much. Please.”
He was the acting student council president for our school, and yet he
88
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
was so completely casual in how he talked, even to seniors. The other third-
years seemed unable to respond. They probably knew of the tension between
Nagumo and Horikita Manabu and didn’t want to get involved.
“Fine. Let’s decide by playing cards.”
“We’re okay with this?” Keisei asked the other first-year, sounding
slightly apprehensive. Ishizaki, Hashimoto, and the others nodded, as did I.
The others eventually nodded too—except Kouenji.
“Kouenji, you object to this?”
Nagumo should’ve just ignored him. Their little exchange in the
gymnasium this afternoon probably made him want to poke the bear.
“I neither approve nor object. The majority has already spoken.”
“I don’t care about the majority. I want to know what you think.”
“Then allow me to answer, student council president. I haven’t the
slightest interest in this exchange. I don’t care enough to either approve or
object. Does that satisfy you?”
Kouenji’s comments seemed designed to cause more problems.
However, Nagumo let loose an unexpectedly amiable laugh.
“Why don’t you join the student council, Kouenji? I’d love to have
someone as interesting as you aboard. I’ve heard you’re fairly accomplished
in both academics and athletics too.”
Everyone in the room, including the third-years, was shocked. Kouenji
was the only one who didn’t react.
“Well, that’s quite unfortunate. I have no interest in the student
council.”
“I suppose you wouldn’t. Well, you’re welcome any time. If you do
happen to develop an interest, call me. Now then, how about we get this card
game started?” Nagumo looked away from Kouenji.
“What game exactly are we playing?”
“How about something simple. Old Maid? The person holding the
joker in the end loses. Two players from each grade will participate in six
games total.”
I wasn’t very familiar with cards, but even I knew about Old Maid.
89
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“The participating students are free to switch out. Just don’t switch in
the middle of a round,” said Nagumo, shuffling the deck.
Once he was done, he handed the cards to the third-years so they could
shuffle as well. To truly ensure that no one could tamper with the cards at all,
the deck was then handed over to the first-years to shuffle. Keisei shuffled
while he looked at us, seeking one other student to participate. Since there
were no volunteers, Hashimoto raised his hand with a look of resignation.

OUR GAME OF Old Maid with first-, second-, and third-years had
begun. Each grade level was scheduled to take two turns at rising early to
make breakfast. So if you played six games of Old Maid with five wins and
one loss, you’d still be fine. Four wins and two losses would be okay too.
“Playing silently isn’t fun at all. Let’s chat,” proposed Nagumo.
He received the deck back from Keisei and dealt the cards.
“I’ll deal the first round. From the second round onward, the loser has
to shuffle and deal.”
The players nodded in agreement. Nagumo hadn’t looked at me once
since entering the room. Even though we’d already met during winter
vacation, I apparently didn’t exist to him.
“Oh, first-years who aren’t playing…just relax. Pretend we’re not here.
Being nervous around your seniors all the time will affect your performance
this week.”
Nagumo could say that, but we couldn’t be as relaxed as we had been a
little while ago. Except Kouenji, who ignored them completely and went to
sleep.
I decided to quietly observe the game to the end.
“Even though it’s just a game, we can’t lose to the first-years, senpai.”
“Unfortunately, I don’t have the best luck. If you expect too much of
me, you’ll be disappointed.”
“It’ll be fine. I think my senpai are all pretty strong. You won’t lose the
first or second game.”
Despite this being a game where chance dictated much of the outcome,
Nagumo brimmed with confidence. They were already approaching the
game’s halfway point.
“Done.”
Ishikura successfully got rid of all of his cards. Vice President
91
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Kiriyama was next, and Nagumo was third. The second-years clinched
victory quickly, adding pressure to the first-years.
“Done.”
Hashimoto put down two cards with matching numbers, bowing to the
third-years as he did so. The remaining players were Keisei and Tsunoda, a
third-year. For such a tense game, the players seemed rather calm. Keisei had
two cards left and Tsunoda one. That meant Keisei was holding the joker. If
the third-year picked the joker, Keisei would be the winner. But after some
deliberation, Tsunoda picked the winning card.
“That settles it.”
“I lost.”
The first round ended with Keisei’s defeat. The first-years had to make
breakfast at least once.
“Let’s keep calm. Losing once or twice isn’t a big deal,” said
Hashimoto. Keisei nodded but seemed apologetic. He was probably worried
he’d lose another round.
“Hey, I already told you, didn’t I? The loser collects the cards and
deals them,” Nagumo said.
“S-sorry,” said Keisei, collecting the cards in a panic.
The second round soon began. From where I was seated, I could see
one of the third-years’ cards. He had the joker. He held it until about halfway
through the round but eventually passed to another student.
The final two players were Kiriyama and Keisei. Keisei couldn’t help
but look incredibly nervous at being in the one-on-one showdown for the
second time in a row. On top of that, judging from the number of cards
remaining, I knew that Keisei was holding the joker.
Kiriyama slowly, hesitantly picked a card. Keisei struggled to keep his
poker face, but he hung his head in defeat. Within the span of a few minutes,
the first-year students had suffered two consecutive defeats. Yahiko, who had
been watching the situation unfold, signaled to Keisei that it was time to
switch.
“Probably for the best,” said Nagumo. Hearing that, Keisei obediently
tagged out and let Yahiko in.
92
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“I’m not good at games like this. Sorry, we’re counting on you,” Keisei
said, settling down to watch the first-years battle.
Of course, Yahiko was probably nervous to face off against seniors.
However, perhaps because he was used to treating Katsuragi with the
deference due an older student, he seemed relatively calm. Still, composure
might not have helped much with Old Maid. I didn’t know how much skill
was involved, but you probably needed at least some luck not to draw the
joker.
“I think it’s time to let the first-years have one,” said Nagumo, perhaps
feeling slightly bad that we’d lost multiple times in a row. “By the way,
Ishikura-senpai. How’s the club been lately?”
“I thought you weren’t interested in basketball.”
“No, I am. I mean, I’m not as interested as I am in soccer.”
“We had some pretty athletic first-years join, so we might expect some
good things next year. We didn’t really achieve much this year, pathetic as it
is to admit that, as the captain.”
Several first-years had joined, but he was probably referring to Sudou,
whose skill had even caught the attention of even a retired third-year.
“I’m looking forward to it.”
“You seem like you’re devoting all your time to the student council.
Don’t you have any lingering attachment to soccer?”
“I wasn’t planning to go pro or anything. Besides, I can continue
playing soccer wherever. Being student council president here was really
appealing.”
“It’s good that you’re putting in effort as president, but I don’t like you
picking fights with Horikita.”
“I don’t mean to pick a fight. I simply want my senpai to acknowledge
me, especially when I’ve admired him for a long time.”
Ishikura shot Nagumo a glance but then looked away.
“I’m first this time,” said Ishikura, laying his cards down flat.
“I’m in, too,” said Yahiko right afterward. He happily placed his final
two cards down. For the first-years to win, Hashimoto had to pull through.
93
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
The number of cards in his hand was decreasing, but all that mattered was
who held the joker.
“All right.”
After another second-year student took third place, Hashimoto also got
rid of his cards.
“Oh, ho, looks like the firs-years survived this time. Congrats.”
“Thank you very much, Nagumo-senpai.”
The final players were Nagumo and Tsunoda. However, Nagumo had
the advantage, with a 50 percent chance of victory.
“Here goes,” said Nagumo, claiming the card on the right. However,
he’d grabbed the joker. “Too bad.”
Nagumo held out the two cards in his hand. Tsunoda picked the card
on the right, just as Nagumo had done.
“That settles it.”
In the end, Nagumo had the joker, and the second-years suffered a
defeat.
“Looks like I got beat. All right, should we start the fourth round?”
Nagumo began dealing the cards, not looking frustrated in the least. “You
first-years finally won a round, so how about you lose again this time? I
mean, we are your seniors. I’d like you to take over our duties.”
“If I remember right, Sudou is from Class D. Who here are Class D
students?” asked Ishikura, looking around.
“Ah, we’re Sudou’s classmates,” said Keisei, looking at me. “Oh, and
we were just promoted to Class C,” he added.
I didn’t expect them to care much about what was going on in the other
grade levels, but when Keisei said that, Ishikura looked impressed.
“Promoted from D to C, huh? That’s amazing.”
“Seems like the former Class D ran out of class points right after they
started at this school, though.”
“Yet they still managed to get promoted. What’s the gap between you
and Class B like?”
94
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
As someone asked that question, though, Ishikura stopped Keisei
before he could answer. “Forget it. This group comprises all classes; I
shouldn’t be adding fuel to a fire,” he said.
It certainly wasn’t the best topic—and wouldn’t be a fun conversation
for Ishizaki, the rest of Class D, or Class B. In the end, the first-years barely
spoke, while Nagumo and the third-years kept the conversation going.
It was the fourth round. After four out of the six players finished up,
Nagumo called for the round to end.
“Both the remaining players are first-years. There’s no need to finish,
right?” he said.
No matter who won, it was still our loss. Yahiko and Hashimoto put
their remaining cards back in the deck. We managed to win against the
second-years just once and lost three times.
We’d only had to cook breakfast twice, but now thanks to this round of
Old Maid, the number had risen. The more we lost, the worse our burden
became.
“Maybe I should switch out,” said Hashimoto. No one seemed willing
to replace him, though, with the feeling of defeat hanging heavy in the air.
“It doesn’t matter who steps in. Anyone is fine. You,” said Nagumo.
He beckoned me over. I wanted to decline, of course, but obviously
couldn’t. Regardless of whether he’d called on me intentionally or randomly,
I had to accept.
“Sorry, Ayanokouji. It’s up to you.”
“Okay.”
Well, three first-years had already played. It wasn’t so strange that I’d
been picked too. Besides, this was just for fun. Win or lose, it was just a
normal game.
As we switched places, Yahiko asked me to deal the cards. I shuffled
the deck and started to deal awkwardly.
“All right, this is the fifth game. I think it’s about time the third-years
go down. Come on, first-year,” said Nagumo, trying to light a fire under our
asses.
95
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
I fanned out my cards and assessed my hand. I had several cards with
the same number and the joker. Unless I handed that card off to a second- or
third-year, we had no chance of winning. I wasn’t very familiar with playing
cards, but I was curious about one thing.
In a sense, drawing the joker at the very onset might be a good thing.
As I finished assessing my hand, the game began, and people took their turns
in order. It seemed no one was going to draw the joker from me.
Occasionally, one of the seniors would put their fingers on the card but then
immediately pulled their hand back.
However, during the fifth round, someone finally took the joker from
me. The senior who took it looked at me for an instant but then immediately
regained his composure and resumed the game. This time, Yahiko was the
first to finish, and then I finished second. The first-years were done.
“The first-years came out on top this time, huh? Maybe the tides have
turned.”
The game came down to a one-on-one between the remaining third-
years. Exactly what Nagumo had hoped for, probably.
Only one game left. As a first-year, I wanted to avoid losing again.
“This next game’s the last one.”
“I’ll deal,” said Ishikura. As he did, Kouenji spoke up.
“Student Council President Nagumo.”
“What is it, Kouenji? Do you finally feel like participating?”
“I’m feeling a tad bit curious, I suppose. How do you foresee this final
game will end?”
Nagumo ignored Kouenji’s pompous way of speaking, focusing only
on the question.
“How do I foresee?” said Nagumo.
Nagumo glanced over the participants.
“Even though this is just a game, the seniors are experienced. It’s
unlikely the first-years are going to win,” he said.
Kouenji closed his eyes and smiled, as though satisfied.
96
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Most probably didn’t understand the intention behind Kouenji’s
question. Only the senior students had a grasp on the situation. I agonized
over what I should do. If I relied on luck alone, I was almost guaranteed to
lose. However, if I attempted to influence the results, I might end up drawing
Nagumo’s attention.
I checked my cards. One of the cards in my hand was the dreaded
joker. I had to get rid of it if I wanted to avoid defeat.
“I’d like to leave the first-years with three losses. But I’m also okay
with four,” said Nagumo. I couldn’t imagine that statement was random.
The final round started, turns being taken in clockwise order. Every
player discarded two cards. In a minute or two, the outcome would be
decided.
97
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
3.9
 
“SORRY, FIRST-YEARS, but I finished first.”
That was Tsunoda. Kiriyama was the next player to finish. That left us
first-year students, Nagumo, and Ishikura. The joker was still in my hand. I’d
given up on winning, so I let the game continue. Yahiko finished next. He
sighed in relief, hand to his chest.
Right after that, Ishikura finished. The match became a showdown
between Nagumo and me.
“You don’t seem to be having fun, Ayanokouji.”
“That’s not true. I just have a hard time expressing myself.”
“Really? You’ve looked kind of pale ever since we started. Have you
had the joker all this time?”
Nagumo’s remarks weren’t strange at all. Since he didn’t have the
Joker and I was the only player left, he obviously knew what that meant.
“You might be right about that,” I replied, trying to be evasive.
Engaging him directly might be bad.
I knew what Nagumo wanted from me, after all. He wanted me to talk
back to him like Kouenji had.
I silently offered him the two cards in my hand. One was the joker, the
other the exact card Nagumo needed in order to win. In all likelihood,
Nagumo would draw the winning card. But I didn’t understand the look on
his face.
Nagumo smiled as he put out his hand.
And then…
“You must be glad, Ayanokouji. Looks like you escaped.”
Nagumo had drawn the joker.
“Talk about a surprise. I was sure you’d draw the winning card,” said
Ishikura to Nagumo.
98
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“In the end, card games come down to luck. When you lose, you lose.”
Nagumo shuffled the two cards in his hand, and offered them to me. “All
right, take your pick.”
From an outsider’s perspective, I had a fifty-fifty chance, but that
wasn’t really the case here. Even though he’d taken the cards from a sealed
box, Nagumo had been the first to deal. That was probably when he’d marked
the joker. Though almost invisible, there was a minute notch on the card.
I’d arrived at this conclusion by looking at the spread of wins. In the
five games so far, Nagumo had predicted the outcomes would be ahead of
time, even though, with inexperienced first-years in play, there should have
been no way of knowing how a game would go. But Nagumo was evasive,
only saying which team had a high probability of winning and which did not.
The senior students who’d realized the trick…no, who’d been told
about it…had an overwhelming advantage. Disgusting. From where I was
sitting, the card on the right was marked, meaning it was the joker. There was
no mistaking it.
If I picked the other card, though, would what happen? The answer was
simple. Nothing. I’d have just won by a fifty-fifty chance.
“I can’t tell which is which no matter how hard I try, so I’m just going
to pick randomly. Here goes,” I said, reaching out. But Nagumo pulled his
cards back.
“Give it some thought before you pick.”
“I don’t know that thinking it over will do anything.”
“Still, try,” he insisted.
“I understand. I’ll give it some thought,” I said, looking at the cards.
Of course, I wasn’t really thinking. After about two seconds, I grabbed
for a card.
“I like the one on the right. I’ll take that one,” I said.
As fine a reason as any. Nagumo didn’t stop me that time, and I drew
the winning card.
“Sorry,” I said, showing that I’d won.
“You lost. Huh, Nagumo?”
99
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Guess so. Well, we were already scheduled to cook breakfast twice
anyway, so I don’t really mind.” He gathered up the cards that were scattered
about. “That was fun, wasn’t it? I think you and I might get along just fine,
Ishikura-senpai.”
“I wonder,” replied Ishikura, brushing aside Nagumo’s seemingly
good-natured words and abruptly leaving the room.
“It’s fine if we start with the first-years, right? Take care of breakfast
tomorrow.”
“Y-yes. Thank you very much,” said Keisei.
The seniors cleaned up the cards, then got up and left.
“Y’know, we didn’t really interact with ’em at all,” muttered Ishizaki. I
understood what he meant.
Ultimately, the game had done nothing but increase the first-years’
ever so slight responsibilities.

Chapter 4:
A Premonition of Defeat
 
WE NORMALLY HAD Saturdays off, but lessons were still being held at
this outdoor school. However, the timetable was slightly different from
weekdays. Our lessons were only in the morning. Once those were finished,
we had free time.
The special exam had started on Thursday. It was already the third day
of camp, and discord was beginning to manifest within the group. It started
early, just after five o’clock in the morning.
“Aah, I’m so goddamn tired!” shouted Ishizaki at the outdoor cooking
area.
“So is everyone else. Ah, please measure the ingredients correctly—
don’t mess up the amount of miso,” said Keisei, flipping through the
breakfast menu the teachers had given us.
“Shut it. Why do I even gotta help make food in the first place?!”
Ishizaki groused, though he kept stirring the miso to make it dissolve.
“Look, we don’t have a choice. We could get hit with a penalty if our
whole group’s not here.”
“Whatever, dude, like hell I care. God damn it. Oh.”
“What was that?”
“Nothin’.”
“No, that was something. Where’s the salt you were just holding?!”
“I put it all in.”
Keisei turned off the fire in a panic. He tasted the soup and choked.
“You put in way too much! Ack! It’s not even edible.”
If we’d given that soup to the seniors, it would have invited a lot of
criticism. Not to mention it was probably unhealthy too.
“You have to start over.”
101
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Screw that. You do it. Or what about Kouenji?”
“It’s not like I know!”
“You’re in the same class, aren’t you?!”
Hashimoto shot a backward glance at the two of them fighting over the
miso soup, his hands occupied by skillfully wielding a frying pan on the
camp stove.
“Dude, you’re really good.”
“I’ve always cooked my own meals,” said Hashimoto without a trace
of arrogance. As he continued to cook up a storm, Albert approached him
silently, carrying a bowl filled with whipped eggs.
“Thank you. If you’re up for it, could I ask you to cut up some
vegetables too?”
Despite his bulky frame, Albert skillfully brought the kitchen knife
down on the cutting board, dicing vegetables with ease. We’d be feeding a lot
of people, so Hashimoto kept churning out fried eggs. Clearly, he and Albert
were our team’s trump cards, as far as cooking went.
Meanwhile, I’d lucked out by landing the easy job of preparing the raw
vegetables and tableware. There were a lot of vegetables to be prepped, and
although I couldn’t help with the frying, I felt I could at least pitch in on the
dicing and chopping. I stood beside Albert and tried to communicate with
him silently, just using my eyes.
Can you handle cutting? Vegetables?
Probably, yeah.
Somehow, we seemed to understand each other—at least enough that
Albert handed over a kitchen knife. Thankfully, living in the dorms had led
me to develop some skill with a knife. I began to dice vegetables, keeping
pace with Albert.
Where had Kouenji gotten to, anyway? It’d already been half an hour
since he went to the bathroom. Classes A and B each sent one student to look
for him, but since they hadn’t returned, it was a safe bet they hadn’t
found him.
In the end, Kouenji didn’t return until breakfast. When he did return,
102
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
all he would say was that he’d been holed up in the bathroom due to a
stomachache. Needless to say, his relationship with Ishizaki was wrecked
beyond hope of repair at this point.

SOMETHING HAPPENED while I was studying morality during our third
period that Saturday. I heard a girl’s cheerful voice outside, and peering out
the third-floor classroom window, saw Ichinose race spiritedly through the
yard. She’d had a difficult time getting the groups coordinated on the first
day, but she seemed cheerful now.
Sakayanagi had enthusiastically declared she would crush Ichinose, but
I saw no sign of that happening. Of course, I could only see what was on the
surface.

As I watched, I was able to discern, to a certain extent, the people who
were members of Ichinose’s group. Surprisingly enough, I spotted only one
person from Class C among them. The Class B students were all unfamiliar
to me, with the exception of Ichinose. Had they gone with the same approach
as the boys—picking the minimum number of people from Class B in order
to have an even mix of people from all four classes?
I wasn’t really sure who the Class A and D students were, but I did
spot the girl who had suffered a severe injury by running into Horikita as a
part of Ryuuen’s ploy during the Sports Festival. Fortunately, she must have
made a complete recovery, for she seemed to be running just fine.
The only student from Class C, meanwhile, was a girl named Wang
Mei-Yu.
She’d come to Japan from China during elementary school and had
remained here ever since. At least, that’s what I’d heard. Her nickname was
Miichan, though only close friends ever called her that. All I knew was that
she did well in class and was especially proficient in English.
Though there were some slight differences in their scores, overall, she
was as academically adept as Keisei. Strangely enough, she was just as
athletic as him too—which was to say she was currently dead last by a wide
margin, despite struggling desperately to keep up with the group. She
staggered along, breathing heavily and looking up at the sky, seeming ready
to collapse.
Ichinose noticed Miichan lagging behind and slowed down. She
matched Miichan’s pace to run supportively alongside the other girl,
encouraging her. Soon after, another girl came up beside them. It was Shiina
Hiyori from Class D. She didn’t seem especially athletic either, but she had a
smile on her face as she ran alongside the other girls.
According to Ryuuen and the people around him, Shiina had taken on
the role of leader of the Class D girls. If that was true, then I was looking at a
girls’ group with two class leaders in it. With that in mind, it wouldn’t have
been strange for Horikita and Sakayanagi to be together too—but they were
apparently in different groups.
Feeling a surge of curiosity about how those groups had come together,
I gazed out the window instead of focusing on the lesson. When our
106
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
instructor spoke up, though, I could tell that things were about to become
difficult.
“We will now begin self-introductions. However, you won’t simply be
introducing yourselves. Please keep in mind that this will be one part of your
lesson. From now on, you will all be giving a speech every day. The themes
will differ between grade levels, but the four fundamental criteria on which
you will be judged are volume, posture, content, and communicativeness.’”
The word speech had indeed cropped up in the syllabus we’d been
given back on the bus, making this undoubtedly one of the subjects we’d be
tested on as part of this special exam. I was willing to bet every member of
our large group would have to deliver a speech they’d composed themselves
at some point. This part of the exam would be hell for people who lacked
public speaking skills.
The instructor went on to notify the first-years that they would be
giving speeches on what they’d learned in their first year of school and what
they’d like to learn in the years to come. The second- and third-years had to
speak about their plans for the future, like attending university or getting a
job.
“For real? Talk about a shit exam,” spat Ishizaki. I understood how he
felt, but he was being much too loud. Even the teacher seemed to have heard
him, though he didn’t take Ishizaki to task over it. We could do as we
pleased, but we needed to remember that our actions would ultimately affect
the group.
When free time rolled around, a young man approached the first-year
group. Ishizaki, who had had his legs sprawled on top of a desk, instantly
corrected his posture. The new arrival was Kiriyama from second-year Class
B, who served as vice president on the student council under Nagumo
Miyabi. He used to be in Class A, but had been demoted after losing to
Nagumo, and it seemed that, deep down, he wished for Nagumo’s downfall.
Horikita’s brother had put us both in touch.
“I think you should adjust your attitude a bit,” he said.
“S-sure. Well, I wasn’t really makin’ any fuss or anythin’.”
“I’m not just talking about you, Ishizaki. That applies to you, too,
Kouenji.”
107
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Much as he might crave Nagumo’s downfall, Kiriyama still had to play
the part of a dutiful vice president. He had to address anything that might
affect the large group’s overall scores.
“We’re going to be evaluated based on the test on the final day, right? I
don’t think taking these lessons seriously is that important.”
“The written test isn’t everything there is to this special exam. Haven’t
you considered the possibility that our instructors will be taking your
behavior in class into account? And how exactly do you plan to score well on
the test if you don’t take the lessons seriously?”
“Simple is best. This is me we’re talking about, no?”
“I see. You’re saying getting a high score is easy for you, eh? Well,
we’ll see if you can make good on those boasts when the special exam comes
around. You’re part of this group—shouldn’t you want to avoid acting in
ways that make your teammates uneasy?”
“A group that’s made uneasy by my actions is a group that has no
value.”
“You don’t get to decide that, Kouenji.”
“Then who, may I ask, does?”
“No one person. The whole group does. Every student here decides.”
Ishizaki couldn’t help but grin after hearing that, probably because he
loved seeing Kouenji get told off. However, common sense wasn’t going to
work against Kouenji.
“I’m worth far more than the rest of you combined. An average person
cannot correctly judge the exceptional.”
“You’re too ignorant and infantile to even be called a high school
student,” Kiriyama said.
Kouenji didn’t flinch, but before I knew it, nearly half of the second-
years had begun to encircle us. Even Ishizaki’s smile faded, his face growing
stiff. Threatening words could be heard being murmured around us.
“Besides, it’s not just Kouenji. There’s a number of you who’ve been
causing all sorts of problems.”
He probably meant Ishizaki, but I honestly couldn’t think of anyone
108
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
else. We’d all been taking the lessons seriously, in our own way. Kiriyama
was probably lumping us first-years together because he wanted us to focus,
letting us know that we’d be earning our seniors’ ire if we continued to
behave impertinently. Kouenji was merely the straw that broke the camel’s
back.
“I think that’s enough, Kiriyama.”
Unable to stand by and watch the situation unfold, Ishikura, a third-
year, stepped in to help.
“I know you’re just trying to coach them, but the way you’re doing it
could come off as bullying. If that happens, you’ll be the one in trouble. The
first-years understand the situation well enough. Isn’t that right?”
Ishikura looked to us for confirmation, and every one of us, including
me, nodded. Except for Kouenji, of course.
“Excellent, Ishikura-senpai. You really got a handle on things, didn’t
you?” said Nagumo happily. He’d been watching the whole thing go down
from the sidelines. “You really are too good to be kept in Class B. Maybe
you’re just really unlucky, Ishikura-senpai.”
“Luck, huh? Much as I hate to admit it, I think it’s just that my skills
aren’t up to par.”
“I don’t think that’s true. The only reason you haven’t been able to rise
to Class A is because there’s a genius like Horikita Manabu in your way. I
know you’ve fought the good fight for three years. There’s a 312-point
difference between Classes A and B right now. Even though graduation is
around the corner, I think you’re closing in on them.”
“Are you saying you’ll lead this group to victory?”
“Exactly. If you’re willing to trust me, Ishikura-senpai, we’ll win this
special exam. And, as I’m sure will bring you no small amount of delight, I’ll
help you get to Class A. We might even be able to get Horikita-senpai
removed from the school. Hmm?”
“Unfortunately, Horikita doesn’t seem to be a group representative.
And you aren’t either, are you, Nagumo? There’s nothing you can come up
with that would be enough to drag him down.”
“It doesn’t matter if he’s the representative or not. There are many
109
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
ways to crush him,” said Nagumo with a laugh.
“Sorry. But I can’t trust you. Not with the fate of Class B.”
“That’s unfortunate.”
Nagumo had simply laid out all his plans in front of everyone. Was he
genuinely that guileless? Or was he just trying to make himself appear
guileless? I doubted it was the former.

AT DINNER, I decided to make some minor moves.
Or so I say, though all I was really trying to do was get a better handle
on the girls’ situation. Ichinose and Shiina being in the same group had
caught me slightly off guard, and I wanted to understand what was up with
the other groups.
I wanted to better understand the girls’ situation, because Ichinose and
Shiina being in the same group had caught me by surprise. I wanted to
understand what was up with the other groups.
Kei was eating in the same place as she had since the beginning, which
made it easy to get in touch. I hadn’t even asked her to do that. She truly was
reliable. I, on the other hand, had been grabbing random seats that just
happened to be open, wanting to avoid openly engaging with Kei, just in
case.
Very few students knew about my strange relationship with Ryuuen
and other members of Class D, or with Kiriyama and Kei. Besides, there
were enemies on the inside of whom I needed to be cautious. I checked my
timing and then sat down near Kei. Just as I was racking my brain over how I
would get her to notice I was there—
“Hmm.”
Kei made some kind of noise, I think as a greeting? It was very soft.
Apparently, she’d noticed me, even though she was enjoying a meal with her
friends. In that case, I would wait patiently until she got rid of them.
She proceeded to eat her meal slowly, letting her friends head back to
the room ahead of her. I’d been considering postponing this meeting if there
was a chance of being interrupted. She couldn’t shake her friends, but she’d
cleverly manipulated them into leaving. Finally, no one was paying attention
to us, and our conversation could start. Of course, we’d immediately cut it
short if someone did come.
“So? It’s the third day, and you finally feel like asking for my help?”
111
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Yes. I have too little information on the girls.”
“No surprises there. Someone with a communication impairment like
yours can only make contact with so many girls.”
She was giving me the cold shoulder, right off the bat. A small price to
pay if it helped Kei feel she had an advantage, and keep our relationship
going…but I decided to be a little mean in response.
112
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
113
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“So, you’ll make it through this special exam even if you get no help
from me?”
“O-obviously. I mean, who do you think I am?”
“I see. Then there’s nothing to worry about.”
“Well, maybe you can analyze my situation just to make sure there’s
nothing to worry about. Okay?” said Kei, looking anxious.
“Tell me how the girls’ groups are divided.”
“Ah, before we talk about that, something’s been on my mind.”
“Make it quick.”
If we spoke too long, people might become suspicious.
“Well, I’d say it’s pretty important… What’s going on with that
Ryuuen guy?”
“Are you worried?”
“Well, yeah. Even the girls are talking about it. Like why he quit being
the leader and all. No one knows what really happened.”
“Well, I wouldn’t ever call Ryuuen ‘gentle as a lamb,’ but he’s been
somewhat domesticated.”
“So raking him over the coals worked?”
“Raking him over the coals?”
Kei hid her vulnerability beneath a tough façade, though her fear
occasionally came into view. Her curiosity probably stemmed from anxiety
over the fact that Ryuuen knew her weakness.
“Don’t worry about Ryuuen. He won’t do anything careless. At the
very least, he won’t be doing anything to you, Kei,” I said, to reassure her.
Kei didn’t respond. Was someone else approaching us? I’d been on my
guard in case that happened…but that didn’t seem to be the case. I
immediately sensed what was going on.
“Sorry. It’s nothing,” she said. I could tell she was lying.
“It doesn’t seem like nothing, Kei.”
“I-I’m telling you, it’s nothing.”
114
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Is that really true, Kei?”
“…Wait a minute. You’re doing this on purpose, aren’t you?!” She
didn’t look at me, but her voice sounded threatening. Maybe I’d pushed her
too far. “Ugh, God. I shouldn’t have given you permission to call me by my
first name.”
“You’re the one who started that in the first place.”
“W-well, yeah.”
More importantly, if she was satisfied by what I’d told her about
Ryuuen, I wanted to get down to business. We were well hidden among all
the hustle and bustle, but if someone happened to notice us, they might
become suspicious of my relationship with Kei.
“Well, I’ve gathered as much information as I could, more or less.
Want to hear it?”
“Yeah.”
“I’m going to say this up front, though—I wasn’t able to get a
complete picture of all of the groups like you wanted.”
“I understand. I wasn’t expecting that much from you.”
“Okay, that’s a super rude way of putting it. Even someone like you
couldn’t know everything about who was put into what group, right?”
“Hmm. I wonder about that.”
“What? You’re saying you’ve memorized where everyone is?”
“I didn’t say that.”
“What group is Shibata-kun from Class B in?”
“He’s in the group of mostly Class B students led by Kanzaki.”
“What about Tsukasaki from Class A?”
“He’s with mostly Class A students led by Matoba.”
“Th-then what about Suzuki-kun?”
“He got assigned to a different small group than the one I’m in.”
“You have memorized everything!”
“Just the people whose names I know. But if I see their faces, I can
115
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
remember where they belong.”
I was grateful that this exam had forced me to memorize the names of
all of the first-year students. Once we were done here, I’d probably be able to
match names to faces with nearly 100 percent accuracy. As long as I hadn’t
missed or misunderstood something, of course.
“Sigh. How is your memory this good? Don’t tell me you’re one of
those nerdy four-eyed try-hards who spends all his time studying or
something.”
Unfortunately, I had no idea what Kei was saying.
“Let’s get down to business. What’s going on with Sakayanagi and
Kamuro’s group?”
“They’re in the same group. It’s made up of students from three
classes, with nine students from Class A. Class A was the first to put their
groups together,” explained Kei.
So, the girls had picked a similar strategy to the Class A guys. Only
they went with nine students instead of twelve.
“The fact that they’ve only got three classes means someone didn’t join
in. Or maybe Sakayanagi didn’t let them in?”
“They wouldn’t accept anyone from Class B. They rejected the idea
right off the bat. They said they couldn’t trust Ichinose or something. Well,
Sakayanagi didn’t say that. Kamuro did.”
“Not able to trust her, huh?”
“I guess you wouldn’t fully trust any student from another class, but
they specifically named Ichinose. But isn’t that kind of weird? I mean, even
I’ve heard nothing but good things about her.”
If I were asked to name a trustworthy student from another first-year
class, I’d have named Ichinose, without a doubt. Of course, there were
probably more than a few people who’d name Kushida, if asked the same
question… At any rate, I estimated Ichinose was in the running for the most
trustworthy person in our grade level.
But if Sakayanagi and Kamuro’s group only had members from three
classes and the minimum number of students, their point multiplier would be
greatly diminished. It was a strategy where absolute victory was impossible,
116
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
but so was absolute loss.
“That’s not fair, right? Class A should just protect themselves. They
were really forceful about how they made the groups.”
“Seems that way.”
A solid, reliable strategy. Sakayanagi had almost certainly devised that
plan. It was surprising that someone as aggressive as her would adopt a
defensive strategy like this.
“So what should I do now? Set a trap or something?”
“Cheap tricks won’t work in this exam. There are some people I’d like
you to monitor, though,” I replied, naming some of the major players.
“Hmm. That’ll be pretty tough, but I’ll try.”
She obediently followed orders. That was Kei’s strong point.
“Anyway, what’s up with this exam? Do we really have to worry about
things like manners and ethics?”
“I wonder. If this were a story, I’d say it was almost like a MacGuffin.”
“Huh? MacMuff—”
“That’s not what I said.”
“I-I know that. So what is it?” She had no idea.
“It’s an element that’s important because it motivates the characters but
is otherwise unimportant to the story itself.”
“I don’t understand. Look, I know you’re a smart guy, Kiyotaka, so
just explain things in a way that’s easy to understand.”
“I’m saying manners and ethics may be necessary but aren’t really
important in and of themselves.”
Dinnertime was almost at an end. Students started to disperse.
“But this exam… Let’s just say a storm is coming.”
“A storm? What do you mean? Are you saying something bad is going
to happen?”
“Relax. At the very least, I say no harm will come to you.” Things
probably wouldn’t get too bad for the first-years this time. I grabbed my tray
117
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
and stood. “If I need you again, I’ll call.”
“Understood.”
With that, I decided to return to the room.
118
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
4.3
 
AS NIGHT FELL on our third day, I entered the large bathhouse. Several
guys were gathered in one corner; I saw not only Yamauchi and Ike but also
some Class B students like Shibata. I exchanged glances with Kanzaki, who
entered the bathhouse at the same time as me.
“This is a pretty unusual combination of people,” said Kanzaki,
surveying the gathering with surprise.
“Yeah, sure seems that way.”
“How’s your group? Any trouble?”
“Dunno. But I can’t say it’s going all that well,” I replied honestly.
Kanzaki seemed unsurprised. “Well, if you have a small group made
up of an uneven number of students from four different classes, there’s bound
to be tension.”
“I wish that were all it was.”
“Moriyama and the others told me. Sounds like you guys really have
your hands full with Kouenji.” A natural assumption, under the
circumstances.
“I’m trying my best as a classmate, but I have absolutely no control
over him,” I said.
“Speaking of control, have you heard about what’s going on with
Ryuuen?”
“No, I haven’t heard anything.”
It was three days since Akito had entered Ryuuen’s group. Even
though we saw each other in the bath, on the way to the toilet, or during
mealtimes, we hardly ever spoke.
“If he were scheming or something, there’d be reports. But I haven’t
heard anything.”
If Kanzaki—Class B’s second-in-command—said no rumors were
going around, then it was probably true. As someone who knew the full
119
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
extent of the situation, I doubted Ryuuen would try anything, but the other
students probably weren’t going to let their guard down for a while. Many
probably suspected he would spring some kind of trap by the end of the
exam.
“If you’re ever in trouble, find me. I’d like for our good relationship
with Class C to continue. Ichinose feels the same way, of course.”
“I sincerely appreciate that.”
“Ichinose seems to have a really high opinion of Horikita. More so for
her honesty than her ability, though.”
“Her honesty? Huh.”
I didn’t know if I would call Horikita “honest” myself, but Kanzaki’s
definition of the word might be slightly different from my own. He probably
meant she had integrity. She was a firm believer in keeping her promises.
You couldn’t expect anything of the sort from Sakayanagi or Ryuuen.
“Oh, Kanzaki! Hey, over here!”
Shibata waved.
“Ayanokouji! You come over too!”
Yamauchi signaled for me. Unable to decline under the current
circumstances, I went.
“What’s up?” said Kanzaki to Shibata.
“Just having a blast with Yamauchi and the guys here. Bein’ totally
honest and talking about something kinda weird.”
“Kinda weird?”
“We’ve been talking about who has the biggest thing in our grade.”
“What thing?”
“Dude, isn’t it obvious what we mean? You know, down there,” said
Shibata with a laugh, pointing at the center of the white towel wrapped
around his hips.
“I see. Sounds like you’re having fun.” Kanzaki released an
exasperated sigh at the childish competition that Shibata was engaged in.
“I mean, yeah, it’s childish. But hey, it’s surprisingly fun.”
120
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Kanzaki and I didn’t get what was so fun about it. We exchanged
glances and decided to keep our distance. When Shibata and the other started
their discussion once again, Kanzaki left. Soon after, I got up to leave too.
However—
“All right, who’s the current size king?” Sudou, probably having
overheard the conversation, showed up. He radiated confidence as he grabbed
tightly me by the shoulders, preventing my escape.
“I have no clue.” I dodged the question. While the majority of us wore
towels, Sudou was proudly naked.
“Oh. That’s what I’d expect from Sudou,” said Shibata. I could tell that
he was anxious.
“Kaneda from Class D’s the current king.”
“Kaneda? That gangly four-eyes?”
Sudou pushed past Shibata.
“Move it,” he said, before joining up with Yamauchi and the others.
Kaneda, who seemed to have no intention of joining in, looked
uncomfortable.
“Oh, dude, Ken, you came! You’re the only one we can count on!”
“Leave it to me.”
Sudou, representing Class C, confronted Kaneda, who looked
perplexed at being dragged into this competition.
“You wear glasses even in the bath?”
“If I don’t, my vision is so bad that I can’t see well enough to walk.”
“That so?”
It wasn’t an aggressive competition. They simply stood next to one
another. The outcome of their showdown was decided in an instant.
“Hot damn!”
Sudou confidently pumped his fist as he posed. He shouted in triumph,
his voice echoing throughout the bath. Kaneda fled, the sentiment “Finally,
the game is over” written on his face. I was sorry he’d gotten dragged into it.
“That settles it. I’m the king!” Sudou declared.
121
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
It was unlike anyone would challenge him, having seen the power he
was packing. I hoped this pointless competition was at an end, but…
“King? Don’t make me laugh, Sudou,” said Yahiko, challenging Sudou
with a loud laugh.
Sudou just glanced at Yahiko’s naked crotch before dismissing him.
“You ain’t no match for me.”
“No, I’m not. But I’m not your opponent.”
“It don’t matter who I’m up against. The result’s the same. The king is
Class D’s—”
“No, Ken, we’re Class C now. Class C.”
“Yeah, that’s right. The king is Class C’s Sudou Ken-sama!”
“You’re just above average. You can’t win against Class A’s
Katsuragi-san!”
Apparently it wasn’t Yahiko challenging Sudou but rather the person
that Yahiko idolized—Katsuragi. The man in question was sitting on a stool
nearby, reaching for some shampoo. Since he was completely bald, I
wondered where exactly he was going to apply the shampoo, then decided
not to ask that question.
“Knock it off, Yahiko,” said Katsuragi. “I have no interest in such
nonsense.”
“We can’t let this pass. We have to win. This is about a man’s pride.
No, Class A’s dignity is on the line!”
“What a stupid competition…”
“But that’s not really true. Is it, Katsuragi?” said Hashimoto. Yahiko
just looked disgusted. “Like Yahiko says, Class A’s pride is on the line. What
you’re packing makes you the only one here that can measure up against
Sudou.”
Hashimoto had personally checked out Katsuragi’s “thing.” He clearly
had confidence that Katsuragi could win, laughing boldly at the possibility of
victory.
Katsuragi, however, made no move to stand.
“Bring it, Katsuragi.”
122
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Katsuragi remained calm in the face of Sudou’s provocation. However,
everyone else was getting fired up. They cheered, wanting to see Katsuragi
and Sudou square off.
“For crying out loud. I can’t even wash my head in peace,” said
Katsuragi.
So that meant that he really was planning on applying shampoo on his
head after all, huh.
“The contest will be over in a second, Katsuragi.”
“Have it your way.”
Katsuragi, having determined the best way was to accept the challenge,
slowly got up. Everyone let out a sigh of admiration at the sight of his large
frame.
“Th-this is…?!”
Yamauchi, who was the judge, crouched down. He scrutinized each
combatant, looking from one to the other, but the differences seemed almost
nonexistent. Sudou offered his opponent praise as he waited for Yamauchi to
pass judgment.
“Nice, Katsuragi. That’s the reason they call you Class A’s trump
card.”
“This is ridiculous…”
“All right, and the judges say—”
Yamauchi stood up.
“It’s a draw!”
Unlikely as it might seem for such a thing to happen in a competition
like this, Yamauchi had determinedly they were evenly matched. Ike,
Shibata, and the others gathered around, ready to object, but Yamauchi’s
judgment seemed sound, because they couldn’t determine who was bigger
either.
“Are we done?” said Katsuragi.
Clearly done with being made a spectacle, he pushed past them and
went back to where he was sitting.
123
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“I hate to admit it, but I guess the two of us share first place,” Sudou
said.
I didn’t think anyone would object to that…but we still weren’t done.
“I had the honor of watching your valiant battle. But my, how naïve
you are,” said Ishizaki from Class D.
“Huh? Don’t make me laugh, Ishizaki. You ain’t a match for me,” said
Sudou with a dismissive laugh. Ishizaki was pretty much on Yahiko’s level.
“I ain’t your opponent.”
“What?”
“You fool! Class D possesses the ultimate trump card!”
“No way. You don’t mean Ryuuen?”
“No!” shouted Ishizaki. “Albert! You’re up!”
The moment Albert’s name was called, there was an uproar. The
thought of Albert had certainly crossed everyone’s minds, but they’d avoided
mentioning him. Now that unspoken rule was broken.
“Hey, that’s not fair!” Even Sudou, who’d been dubbing himself a king
moments ago, couldn’t hide his nervousness.
“Deal with it. If we’re measuring who’s number one in our grade, then
Albert is on our team!”
Ishizaki had a point, but no one could deny a fight that crossed into
international territory put us at a disadvantage. Japan’s professional baseball
players, for instance, were highly skilled—but if you looked at foreign
players in the major leagues, the difference in physicality was obvious.
Foreigners were just made differently from us, both in terms of build and
genetics.
Albert approached silently. Sudou and Katsuragi were well built, but
they couldn’t compare to his muscular frame. Also, for some reason, Albert
was still wearing sunglasses in the bath. Maybe they had some kind of anti-
fogging solution applied to the lenses, because he moved with no problem.
“Damn, he’s huge…”
Albert had a bath towel wrapped around his hips, so Sudou’s muttered
words had to be referencing his physique. Now that I saw them side by side,
124
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
the difference was clear. It was like the difference between a junior high
student and a college student. It followed that the same should apply to the
weapons they wielded. Though it might be precious little help to him here, all
Sudou could do was pray Albert wasn’t packing more firepower than him.
“Bring it on!” Sudou shouted, showing no fear. As the king, he
couldn’t run away.
Albert didn’t say a word, but he was plenty intimidating, even so. He
let Ishizaki remove his bath towel. The veil had been lifted. Everyone, not
just King Sudou, watched with rapt curiosity. Was this a weapon worthy of a
final boss? Or, in a stunning upset, would he be wielding something minute?
It was a clash between beasts—the most primal kind of battle.
“Go, Albert!” cheered Ishizaki as Albert’s fighting prowess was made
clear.
“Th-this is…?!”
Unveiled before the eyes of the current king was Albert’s true form,
which he’d kept hidden so far. The crowd fell silent.
“I…lost.”
Two simple words from King Sudou. He collapsed to his knees,
struggling with overwhelming defeat. Unlike the contest with Katsuragi,
there was no need for judgment here. The difference was just that extreme.
“This means Albert’s…the final boss!”
Yamauchi, Shibata, and the others folded like Sudou had, their spirits
crushed. No one was capable of challenging Albert. The winds of despair
began to howl. Albert slowly bent over, maneuvering his large bulk as he
picked up the towel and walked off. Everyone fell to their knees in despair,
recognizing their horrible defeat.
“Ha ha ha. You are all amusing yourselves like children, it seems.”
Kouenji’s voice cut through the dreary mood like a knife. He’d been
observing the commotion from inside the hot tub.
“The hell, Kouenji? Aren’t you frustrated, too? Look at the state Sudou
is in right now!” shouted Yamauchi. Sudou was still too anguished to be able
to stand back up.
125
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“I know. But Red Hair-kun put up a good fight.”
“The hell, dude? Are you tryin’ to say you can square off against
Albert?” said Sudou, the life gone from his eyes.
“I am a perfect being. As a man, I possess the ultimate body.”
“Don’t dodge the question. What are you saying, specifically?”
Kouenji ran his hand through his hair, without getting out of the tub.
“There is no need for a competition, precisely because I know that
there is no one superior to me. So, there is no need to war over something so
pointless.”
“So you say. But it’s not true, is it?” said Yamauchi, baiting him.
However, Kouenji showed no signs of nervousness.
“You truly are a fool. However, it might be fun to play along with you
on occasion.” He swiped his hair back from his face, looking as though he
intended to accept the challenge. “Now then, shall I assume that Aaaalbert-
kun is my opponent in this little competition?”
Why did he say Albert’s name like that?
“No. It’s Katsuragi-san!” shouted Yahiko.
“Leave me out of this, Yahiko…” said Katsuragi.
“There’s no way Kouenji can win if he goes up against Albert! On
behalf of the Japanese people, I’m begging you, Katsuragi-san, you must
defeat him!”
Well, I supposed Yahiko and Kouenji were in the same group. Even
though he’d been seated nearby, Kouenji probably didn’t know in detail the
kind of fighting power that Sudou and the others held. If Katsuragi, who was
an even match for Sudou, stepped forward…then maybe he stood a decent
chance of victory.
“For crying out loud… All right, just this once,” said Katsuragi,
exasperated. He stood to represent the Japanese people, his package swaying
left and right as he did. The guys gazed at it as if they were looking upon
something divine.
“A-as I thought, he really is huge. I mean, even he can’t go up against
Albert, but if Kouenji—”
126
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Heh. I see. So you’re not called a king for nothing, eh?”
“Please just end this.”
“However, you are no match for me.” But Kouenji made no attempt to
get out of the bath.
“Hey, hey. You ain’t scared or nothin’, are ya, Kouenji? Or are you all
talk, hidin’ your thing away in the tub?” Ishizaki said, trying to needle
Kouenji into making a move.
“I’m not so foolish as to direct my blade toward an unworthy
opponent.”
“Heh. In that case, we’ll break your spirit ’til there’s nothin’ left. Right,
Albert?!”
Albert, the great foreign threat, stood next to Katsuragi. When he did
so, a strange phenomenon occurred: Katsuragi’s thing looked small in
comparison. Upon seeing that, Kouenji’s expression changed dramatically for
the first time.
“Bravo!” He clapped his hands. “I see, I see. As I would expect of the
one representing the rest of the world, it would appear that you aren’t all
talk.”
“Do you get it now, Kouenji? How much of a clown you are?”
“I’ve had enough of this,” said Katsuragi. After he finished washing
off his body, he entered the tub and kept his distance from Kouenji. Everyone
ignored him, now completely absorbed in the battle between Kouenji and
Albert.
“Normally, it is not my policy to show it to men. But this is a one-time
deal.”
Kouenji stood, grabbing a towel and wrapping it around his hips to
conceal his weapon.
“S-so you really gonna do it, Kouenji?”
The ultimate eccentric and the king were going head-to-head.
“I’ve known the outcome of this battle from the start. Now everyone
here shall bear witness too.”
Kouenji struck a pose as he removed the towel that had been
127
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
concealing his lower half. In that instant, a dazzling light hit everyone’s eyes.
A mighty sword, complete with a dyed blond lion’s mane. No, it was too
enormous to simply be called a sword.
I heard Albert mutter softly in English beside me.
“Oh, my God,” he said.
“And thus, I have proven that I am a perfect being.”
The guys who’d just borne witness couldn’t even utter a sound.
“Are you even human?” said Sudou. That was all he could say in the
face of a power so overwhelming, it crossed national borders.
If Sudou and Katsuragi were rifles and Albert was a bazooka, then
Kouenji was a tank. Nobody could win against such overwhelming
firepower. Its colossal size, armor, and destructive power would take down
anyone in its path. There wasn’t a single student in this massive bathhouse
that could defeat Albert…which meant none of them who could stand up to
Kouenji either.
Then, just as everyone was about to hand him the crown…
“Ha. Hold it, Kouenji.”
A voice emerged from the vicinity of the tub that Kouenji had been in
moments ago.
“R-Ryuuen…?” someone stammered.
Ryuuen, the former leader of Class D himself, was warming up in the
whirlpool bath, near Kouenji. There was fire in his eyes. He must have been
watching Albert and Kouenji’s battle.
“You can’t possibly think you’re a match for me,” Kouenji said.
“No. Not even I can win against that thing you’re packin’. However,
there might be at least one person here who could give you a good fight.”
Everyone started looking around at each other as he said that, even
though there was no way such a person could exist. Then I realized what he
meant.
Ryuuen had caught me in his trap.
“Oh, ho? And who might that be?” asked Kouenji. His interest must
128
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
have been piqued.
“Can’t say. But if I’m not mistaken, there is still one person here
covering himself up with a towel, hiding his true power.”
Having dropped that bomb, Ryuuen entered the bath and turned his
back to us. Fortunately, only a few people seemed to buy what he’d said…
and yet, everyone’s gazes were intensifying. Somehow, I felt like not just the
current occupants of the bathhouse but people all throughout Japan were now
paying attention.
“No way. A guy like you? No way, dude,” said Yahiko, glaring at me.
“Are you really taking what he said at face value?” I asked.
“I don’t intend to, but…it’s kind of curious that you’re the only one
still covering yourself up all this time.”
“Curious or not, I just never had any intention of joining this game.” I
took a step back.
“Okay, fine. But let us check, just in case.”
Yamauchi and Yahiko approached, as though they were trying to flank
me. Ryuuen wore a smug smile on his face.
I’m gonna make you taste defeat.
That’s what his look and smile said.
Just as I thought…
Ryuuen, who had no way of knowing what my member looked like,
had intentionally set this up. He was intent on making me lose, one way or
another. It was a malicious sort of attack, very much like Ryuuen.
I could use all my strength and bolt from the bathhouse, but then I’d
have to forego bath time while here at the camp. Sooner or later, the veil
would be lifted. I could try to turn the tables and punch out every student
here, but that strategy was hardly worth consideration. Either way, I lost.
There was no way I could avoid this incomprehensible battle anymore.
Kouenji, seeing I wasn’t budging an inch, laughed.
“Ha ha ha! No need to feel embarrassed, Ayanokouji Boy. Even if you
happen to be wearing protection, that’s something a lot of Japanese children
do. It’s an important thing to protect.”
129
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“You’re not protecting anything though, Kouenji.”
“That’s because I possess overwhelming strength, you see. I have no
need for armor.”
I had to get out of this. Think. Find a means of escape—
“You guys, do the chant. The chant.”
Despite having dropped out of this competition himself, Ryuuen
spurred everyone else on from where he sat in the bath, setting off another of
his traps. He countered my strategy, ensuring I could no longer escape.
“Take it off! Take it off! Take it off!”
All the guys started chanting, calling for me to take it off. The identity
of the person goading them on didn’t matter one bit to them. I was trapped,
all thanks to Ryuuen. And all I’d wanted was to wash away my fatigue after a
tiring day…
“All right.”
Sometimes, you just had to fight. I had no choice but to admit that now
was one of those times. And as a man, if you had a weapon, you should wield
it. Winning or losing didn’t matter, and nor did pride.
As a man with a weapon, if you have to fight, then you should fight.
What was important here wasn’t winning or losing, nor was it something like
pride.
“Fine, whatever.”
“Do you want me to put you out of your misery, Ayanokouji? Read
you your last rites?” asked Sudou. I waved him away.
Everyone kept calling for me to take it off, so I removed the towel
wrapped around my hips, and then…
The chanting suddenly dropped. There was complete silence, as if the
unruly noise earlier were just a dream.
“F-for real, dude? Ayanokouji, he…”
“I don’t believe it…”
The guys spoke in whispers.
“Well, well. I’m honestly impressed, Ayanokouji Boy. To think there
130
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
exists a Japanese person who can hold their own against me. Truly, a margin
of a few millimeters might as well be nonexistent.”
“It’s like a showdown between two T-rexes…”
The guys looked on with admiration and exasperation.
“You are all living witnesses to history,” said Kouenji, tossing his
towel over his shoulder with a laugh. “However, victory is mine. If they are
both T-rexes, as you put it, then the difference lies in the number of prey
they’ve devoured. In other words: experience.”
Without supplying any further details, Kouenji dipped back in the tub.

IT WAS 1:00 A.M., well past lights-out, and I was lying awake in my bed.
Everyone else was sleeping soundly. I should have been sleeping in order to
prepare for tomorrow. That reason I was still awake lay in the single piece of
paper beneath my pillow with the number 25 written on it.
The note’s simplicity didn’t leave much to the imagination. The memo
represented 25:00—in other words, one o’clock in the morning. I didn’t have
any clue about who had put the note there, but I was awake now so I could
find out. If it were just a simple prank or something completely different
from what I was imagining, then, well, that would be that. I could just use
this time to calm down and think about things.
What lay at the heart of this special exam? The bigger picture was
slowly coming into view, bit by bit. Of course, this was all speculation, since
we hadn’t been told exactly how the test would be scored. But I did know for
a fact that there were going to be several things included in this exam.
Zen.
We would be graded on everything from our manners at the start of
zazen to the posture we held during it. If we behaved inappropriately or did
anything that got us smacked by the zen stick, we’d probably have points
docked for it.
Long-Distance Relay Race.
That sounded simple. A test of our speed.
Speech.
Every person in the large group would deliver a speech on four criteria,
aforementioned. The grading system for this had already been disclosed.
Written Exam.
I expected this would focus on the subject of ethics. It sounded like it
would be a standard essay-based test.
There were other things that concerned me, like “cleaning” and
“cooking meals,” but I couldn’t determine how those would be scored yet. In
133
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
some cases, things like tardiness or causing trouble might also be included in
our assessments.
A lot of students were probably agonizing over how to approach this
completely different special exam. A strategy, while vital, could only be
devised once you understood something’s true nature. The goal of this exam
was ostensibly to make us work as a group, support each other, and earn a
high average score. Simple, on the face of it.
But though it might sound easy at first, you could tell just from
watching the groups be formed that this was going to be an uphill battle. It
was extremely difficult for students who were normally hostile toward one
another to truly cooperate. Horikita and Hirata, to speak of our own class, or
Ichinose and Katsuragi, to speak of others, were probably focusing on
encouraging such cooperation. Wielding influence within your group and
having leadership skills made all the difference.
Selecting the members of your group was important, of course, but it
was nearly impossible to tell right off the bat which students were capable of
scoring well in this exam. Although Keisei’s academic prowess was nothing
to scoff at, and thus, he could be expected to do well in that regard, he
seemed to struggle with even the two five-minute sets of zazen on the first
day. Some students couldn’t cross their legs at all.
It was still too early to tell whether academic or athletic skill would be
a good measure of how students would do from here on out. Rather, it was
the most adaptable students who were likely to come out on top.
Additionally, it was probable that more than a few students were opting
to pursue strategies that deviated from the basic one of encouraging
cooperation. I’d sensed when the rules were explained to us that even the
school had struggled to prepare for this rather unorthodox special exam. This
had been true of every special exam, of course, but there had always been
loopholes in the rules to exploit. Blind spots that the school couldn’t see.
Such as how Ibuki and Horikita had traded blows back on the uninhabited
island, even though violence was prohibited.
Of course, if you did happen to get caught committing breaking the
rules, then the consequences would be huge. The majority of the students
probably wouldn’t risk it, with immediate expulsion at stake. Besides, the
situation was far too complex for a mere rule violation to secure you a
134
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
victory.
Could you find a barely existing blind spot, exploit a loophole, and
take a shot that would somehow outdo the people following the traditional
strategy? A high hurdle to overcome. I’d tried a lot of things in the special
exams we’d had so far. On the uninhabited island, I had Horikita retire and
switched up leaders. On the cruise ship, I had the trick with my phone. I
purposefully drew attention to myself during the Sports Festival. And I shut
Kushida down during the Paper Shuffle.
But this time, I’d decided not to take action. I would just sit and
observe, continuing to collect information. I had determined that was what I
had to do in order to fade into the background and graduate like any ordinary
student. Even if that meant Class C took some hard blows this time around, I
wouldn’t do anything.
I also wanted to show Sakayanagi and Nagumo, who both had a certain
degree of interest in me, that I had no intention of fighting…though I had my
doubts about how well that would work. Horikita’s brother couldn’t really
blame me for anything if all I did was observe. However, there was one
measure I could take, and it was defense. If there were a student out there
who was trying to get me expelled, then it was only natural that I would
defend myself.
It was already past 25:00 now, and I had yet to see anything out of the
ordinary. If that was the case, should I go back to sleep?
But just then, something happened.
The hallway door cracked open slightly and a little bit of light came
through. It was Morse code. They were communicating via the flickering
light. Since it was extremely dark in the hallways at night, several flashlights
had been made readily available to us, and the person out there was probably
using one. Light made no sound. The perfect way to signal me to come meet
with them.
I got out of bed and silently stood. Our rooms weren’t equipped with
toilets. Getting up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night was a
perfectly natural thing to do.
135
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
4.5
 
THE CORRIDOR WAS pitch-black, but I could tell someone was moving
from the faint sound of footsteps. I followed that sound, and the person
holding the light turned out to be Horikita Manabu.
“Huh, to think you’d contact me. Isn’t that kind of conspicuous?” I
asked.
In order for him to place a note on my bed, he’d have to know where I
slept. In that case, there were only a couple people who might have helped
him. It was probably either Ishikura or Tsunoda, the third-year students
who’d played cards with Nagumo. They could have told Horikita which bed
was mine.
“More than a few students meet in secret when others are fast asleep.
There are probably two or three schemes being implemented during this
exam, after all.”
Everyone—first-, second-, and third-years alike—was pulling out all
the stops in order to win. That being said, such clandestine meetings rarely
led to anything good.
“Do you know why I called you here?”
“Because Nagumo is acting weird. I can’t think of any other reason.”
“Exactly. I thought you might have something on him, since you’re in
the same large group. Plus, I wanted to respond to the message you sent me
back on the bus.”
“I’ll say this up front: prepare to be disappointed. There’s no sign
Nagumo is up to anything strange.”
I was lying. There were several things about Nagumo’s behavior that
concerned me. He’d directly challenged the elder Horikita to a contest in
front of a huge crowd of people, and losing that contest would be a pretty
poor showing for the second-years. Both his upperclassmen and
underclassmen would view him with skepticism in the future.
If you were going to do combat in public, you should do so only when
136
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
you were sure the odds were in your favor. I didn’t sense that was the case
here. Since Horikita’s brother had instructed Nagumo to fight fair and square,
I’d expected Nagumo to be strict about making sure everyone in our large
group paid attention to our lessons…but there was no sign of him doing
anything of the sort.
That was probably making Horikita Manabu anxious. If not, he
wouldn’t have taken the massive risk of contacting me like this.
“Then you think Nagumo is going forward without any kind of
scheme?”
“Who knows? I think not involving any third parties really limits what
you can actually do.”
Even if you could remind people not to talk in class, doze off, or be
late, that wasn’t going to improve test scores by leaps and bounds. At most, it
might avoid having points docked.
“Currently, our large group is more unified,” Horikita’s brother calmly
assessed.
True, his group was mostly composed of Class A students, including
those from the first year. Whatever the test was, there was a strong chance
they’d win. That had to be why he felt anxious about Nagumo’s inaction.
“What are the odds he’ll go back on his word?” I said. “Maybe he
wants to see you lose no matter what it takes.”
“Nagumo shows no mercy to those who defy him. He’s employed
underhanded methods like Ryuuen more than once. He’s also directly
responsible for the second-years’ unusually high expulsion rate. However,
he’s never once broken a promise.”
“You believe he’s serious about not involving any third parties?”
“Yes.”
Horikita’s brother nodded decisively. He and Nagumo had served
together on the student council for nearly two years, and he must have seen
how the other boy operated. I had my doubts, but hearing the certainty in his
voice gave me that answer. An answer that applied not just to Horikita’s
brother, who was before me right now, but perhaps to all the second- and
third-year students too.
137
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
After hearing those words of absolute certainty from him, I felt doubt
at first, but then I had arrived at my answer. I could say that for Horikita’s
brother, who was in front of me right now, and perhaps for all of the second-
year and third-year students as well.
I should give Horikita’s brother some advice here and now. But it
probably wouldn’t do much good. He’d already determined that his best
defense was to trust in his enemy’s principles.
“This has been a waste of time, apparently,” said Horikita’s brother,
turning his back to me. “Oh, to answer your earlier question… The student
council can influence the special exams. The council is supposed to represent
the students’ perspectives and can therefore make significant revisions to
penalties or meddle with the rules. However, the council cannot make these
decisions on a whim.”
“I see.”
With that, Horikita left.
“He might lose,” I muttered, unable to keep it in.
Well, perhaps that was the wrong word. Horikita’s brother would make
no mistakes. He would doubtlessly manage his group well. But even so, we
clearly didn’t fully understand this exam. It was possible this would
drastically change the course of our third semester.

Chapter 5:
The First Half of the Girls’ Battle:
Ichinose Honami
 
BY THE TIME day three rolled around, it seemed like a lot of stuff had
happened with the boys. But as a girl, I, Ichinose Honami, couldn’t know the
details.
Let’s rewind to the day that the special exam started and tell the story
from there.
“Now that we’ve formed our groups, let’s do our best to get along,
everyone!”
That was what I said to all the members of my group before bedtime.
Despite the many twists and turns, ups and downs, and ongoing drama, at
least I now knew the allies who’d be facing this exam by my side.
Wang Mei-Yu-san, Shiina Hiyori-san, Yabu Nanami-san, Yamashita
Saki-san, Kinoshita Minori-san, Nishino Takeko-san, Manabe Shiho-san,
Nishi Haruka-san, Motodoi Chikako-san, Rokkaku Momoe-san, and I formed
a group of eleven people. I was the only one from Class B, and there was also
only one person from Class C. The rest were from Classes A and D. Manabe-
san and Nishino-san seemed to be considered problem children even within
their own class. In short, we were a group of oddballs.
I didn’t know Mei-Yu-san well, and the remaining students who’d
been brought in to fill the group didn’t really know each other either. I
needed to hurry up and build some relationships—fast.
“Let’s do our best, Ichinose-san.”
“Looking forward to working with you, Shiina-san. I’ve wanted to get
to know you for a while.”
“Is that so? That’s an honor.”
But as for Class C—no, they were Class D now—we hadn’t really
mingled with any of them at all. With Ryuuen-kun behind them, we could
never get to a place where we could befriend them, no matter what we did. I
139
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
supposed it was still unclear whether he really had stepped down or not, but
since we’d finally put this group of girls together, I wanted us to get along.
The main thing we needed to avoid was someone being expelled if our
group fell short. In other words, we needed to avoid someone invoking the
solidarity rule and dragging another person down with them. Even if my first
loyalty was to my comrades in Class B, now that we’d formed this group, I
couldn’t play favorites. That was what I had told myself.
Wang Mei-Yu-san wasn’t actively participating. To be more precise, it
felt like she couldn’t participate even if she wanted to. It would be simple for
me to lend a hand, but this group was mainly composed of girls from Class A
and Class D, many of them ones with big egos. If I stuck my nose in where it
didn’t belong or tried to forcefully lead them along, they might decide they
couldn’t trust me.
So I decided to wait. If no one else took the initiative and started
helping Wang Mei-Yu-san, I’d do something about it.
“Hey, you’re Wang Mei-Yu-san, right?”
“Y-yes.”
Shiina-san approached her, addressing her gently. Shiina-san had taken
on the role of representative, even for a group like this. She was a really
reliable person. I hadn’t put myself forward for the role, partly because
Shiina-san had volunteered right away, but also because I didn’t think that we
could really aim for the top spot with the members we had.
“This all must make you really nervous, huh? I mean, being
surrounded by people you don’t know.”
“U-um, well, I wouldn’t…”
“It’s completely understandable if you’re feeling bewildered,
especially when you’re surrounded by strangers and told to get along with
them.”
“Yeah. Exactly, Shiina-san.”
You couldn’t transform a group of strangers into friends just because
you wanted to. It was the kind of thing that happened naturally or not at all. If
you overthought it, you’d lose your footing and fail.
“Hey, Ichinose-san. Have you ever had a boyfriend?” asked a girl from
140
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Class A.
“Well… I’m embarrassed to say it, but no. I don’t have any romantic
experience.”
“I see. Huh, you look like you’d be super popular, though. Maybe
you’re the type of girl who has really high standards or something.”
“I don’t really think I am, but…I dunno.”
“Well, do you like any guys?”
“Huuuh?!”
The question was so sudden, I couldn’t help but panic.
“There are rumors going around. People say they see you hanging
around with Nagumo-senpai a lot, just the two of you…”
Well, it was certainly true that I’d been working a lot with President
Nagumo after joining the student council. I’d never imagined it would lead to
rumors like this, though.
“Setting aside whether I like him or not, I’m really not even on the
student council president’s radar. He doesn’t look at me that way.”
“No way, that can’t be.”
“Yeah. I mean, you’re you, Ichinose-san. It wouldn’t be strange if you
and Nagumo-senpai started going out.”
“Either way, there isn’t anyone I like now…”
“Wait, right now? So you used to like someone?”
The girls started to grow excited all at once. This was a dangerous
topic if you misspoke.
“No, you got it all wrong. Well, I suppose there was this senpai I
admired, but before I realized that I had a crush on him, he graduated…” I
trailed off, trying frantically to deny it.
The girls all exchanged looks before bursting into laughter.
“What? What? Did I say something weird?” I asked.
“No. It’s just, like, you’re answering these questions all so seriously.”
“Ichinose-san, you’re way too honest. It’s okay to just brush off stuff
141
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
you don’t want to answer, okay?”
“Does that mean you dodged the question yourself earlier, Chikako-
chan?”
“Eek.”
And so our girls’ night gathering grew lively once more. How should I
put it? It felt like we could talk forever and never get sleepy.
“Hey, I’m not gonna answer any questions I don’t want to, okay?”
“Okay, then, how many times has someone confessed to you so far?”
“Huh? Um, three times. Well, if you’re including preschool, four
times. I think. And if I add in that one other time, then five.”
“See, you did answer!”
“Nyaa!”
I was no good at talking about romantic stuff. I was so unfamiliar with
anything of the sort, I was afraid I’d slip up and prove my ignorance.
“Hmm, I wonder. Could it be that Ichinose-san is the kind of person
who’s incapable of lying?”
“You may be right.”
The girls were getting really fired up. It was probably better to deny
that.
“That’s not true. Really.”
“Really?”
“For example, you might need to make a gamble or two during the
special exams, right? I might try to mislead someone in a situation like that.”
“Then you’re fine with telling lies.”
“Hmm. I don’t think that’s quite right, either. I don’t think anyone
really wants to tell lies. The best way to put it might be… I try to tell the truth
as much as possible. Well, that’s not entirely right either. I guess I don’t like
telling lies to avoid hurting people…”
“Isn’t that kinda weird, though? I mean, wouldn’t you want to lie to
avoid hurting people?”
142
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Yeah. I think lies told to avoid hurting people are definitely gentle, as
lies go.”
But…that wasn’t really the case for me.
That was right. This was the ordeal I’d set for myself.
“I think a lie told to avoid hurting someone is just delaying the pain ’til
later…”
A single lie could lead to something much, much worse down the road.
I never wanted to go through that again. Those painful days. That cruel time.

Chapter 6:
Ubiquitous Things
 
SUNDAY CAME AND WENT in a flash, and it was now Monday, the fifth
day of the test. All four hours of our morning lessons were devoted to
exercise. We had to walk or run an eighteen-kilometer course that was going
to be used for the long-distance relay race, and then be back for our afternoon
lessons. Since it was a relay race, each person would only be running a
kilometer or two. But we were in the mountains, and the way could be rocky
and steep.
We walked for about five kilometers, exhausting our stamina. The
other day, we’d only worked up a light sweat. The difference between then
and now was incredible.
“Seriously, how much higher does this slope go?! This is friggin’ nuts,
dude. This is way too hard,” spat Ishizaki as we passed a sign telling us to be
wary of wild boars. He turned back toward me, with a look in his eye that
suggested he’d spied something unpleasant. “Speaking of wild boars, are the
ones here pretty big? Like this guy?”
“Truly amazing. I underestimated you, Ayanokouji.”
Hashimoto and a bunch of other guys started complimenting me, which
just made me extremely uncomfortable. Knowing they were going to use this
joke to mess with me for a while was profoundly awkward. Albert even went
so far to applaud.
But soon, they were out of time to tease me.
Even though the road that led to the summit was paved to allow
vehicles, the incline was extremely steep. Simply walking up it was going to
strain our legs. On top of that, since we’d been getting up early to make
breakfast, we were more tired than the upperclassmen. We only got a break
on Sunday because the school showed some mercy.
“How long is it gonna take for us to get back?”
“The average person’s walking speed is four kilometers per hour. It’s a
distance of eighteen kilometers. If we walk the entire time, it’ll take four and
144
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
a half hours.”
“You’ve gotta be screwing with me. We ain’t gonna have any time left
to eat lunch!”
“Then we have to run, Ishizaki. The more we run, the sooner it’ll be
over,” said Class B’s Moriyama, rather bitterly.
Though our whole large group had started out together, most of the
second-year and third-year students were moving faster than us.
“Don’t talk crazy. No way in hell I can run eighteen kilometers.”
“Don’t tire yourself out by talking for no reason. We’re all here
because you agreed with my strategy, right?” warned Keisei, panting heavily
as he spoke.
Students with decent stamina could have started to sprint right away,
but doing that continuously for eighteen kilometers certainly wasn’t the best
idea. Keisei’s strategy was that we would walk for the first nine kilometers
until we reached the turnaround point and run from there. We’d mostly be
going downhill by then, something that Keisei had factored into his proposal.
“We ain’t even started runnin’ yet. Like hell we’ll be able to hold out
until the turnaround point.”
“Shut up… Just be quiet and walk.”
Keisei wasn’t very good with physical exertion. His legs must have
been hurting him already, because his composure was starting to fray. With
thirteen kilometers or so to go, we might not be able to make it back within
the stipulated time. It was only natural to want to keep talking to a minimum
and focus on walking.
That said, this exercise had made me begin to understand who the
runners were. Yahiko and Keisei were definitely not suited to this task.
Kouenji, who was lagging behind us, could probably be an asset to the group.
But I doubted he’d take it seriously enough to run.
“Be quiet and walk, huh? You’re actin’ all high and mighty for
someone who looks like a zombie, Yukimura.”
Ishizaki kept at it. It didn’t seem like there’d be any cutting back on the
chatter.
145
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“I’m saying this for the sake of the group, as the representative. Please
don’t talk.”
“Oh, as the representative? Screw you.”
Maybe because of all the stress he was under, Ishizaki just kept
verbally assaulting Keisei. Moriyama and Tokitou from Class B couldn’t let
that slide.
“Enough, Ishizaki. Yukimura’s right.”
Sensing someone behind me was getting further away, I turned to find
that Kouenji had veered off the byroad and gone into the forest. No one else
had noticed. They were solely focused on looking ahead. Ishizaki wasn’t our
only problem child. I couldn’t see Kouenji anymore and there wasn’t any
sign that he was coming back; this probably wasn’t a minor detour.
“Well, it is what it is…”
I considered quietly chasing after Kouenji, but everyone might think
I’d ditched too. So I spoke up.
“Kouenji went off on some other path back there. I’ll go call him
back.”
“Huh? What in the hell is that weirdo doin’?!” With no students around
who seemed capable of stopping him, Ishizaki’s voice seemed to just get
louder and louder.
“Don’t let him distract you, Ishizaki. If you don’t ignore Kouenji,
you’ll only be hurting yourself.”
Keisei’s strategy was to treat Kouenji as if he were invisible. A sound
strategy, but ignoring him completely was easier said than done.
“Sorry, Kiyotaka. Can I leave this to you?” asked Keisei
apologetically.
I could tell Keisei didn’t have the energy to go back and look for
Kouenji. I told him I’d do it.
“Hey, this is Kouenji we’re talking about. Won’t he be kind of a
handful? Want me to help?” offered Hashimoto. However, I politely declined
his offer.
“No matter who goes, we might not be able to bring him back. Getting
146
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
as many people as possible to finish the run would look better to the school. I
don’t see how I could get lost on this route, anyway.”
“You’re probably right. Come back the moment you think it’s a lost
cause, though.”
I nodded my assent and went in pursuit of Kouenji. I hadn’t planned on
actively making a move, but I wasn’t often in a position to speak privately
with Kouenji. If I was going to talk to him, this was probably my only
chance.
147

THE NARROW PATH was just a dirt road. Despite the poor terrain, I
picked up my pace. If Kouenji was on foot, I calculated I could catch up to
him in a minute or two. However, he must have gone faster, because there
was no sign of him.
“What a pain in the neck…”
Going faster was one thing, but running down a dirt road was
troublesome. I increased my pace, looking for any tracks Kouenji might have
left behind on foot. After a hundred or so meters, I finally spotted him up
ahead.
As I looked at his back, I remembered a similar situation back on the
island, when Airi had been there. Kouenji had left us in the dust back then
too.
“Kouenji,” I called, closing the distance between us.
“Oh, ho, if it isn’t Ayanokouji Boy. This isn’t the correct route, is it?”
“I’m here to keep you from potentially getting expelled via the
solidarity rule. Why did you take this detour?”
“I caught a glimpse of a wild boar. I dare say I was interested. So I
gave chase.”
That certainly wasn’t what I’d expected to hear. I refrained from asking
what he planned to do if he found it.
“Rest easy. I shall return in time. It shouldn’t take someone like me
even thirty minutes,” he added.
Looked like I had no choice but to trust him.
“Incidentally, do you have any other business with me?” asked
Kouenji. He must have sensed something was up because I hadn’t walked
away.
“About the exam. I want you to help the group.”
“I’m getting so tired of hearing people say that to me. I feel like my
148
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
ears will start to bleed if I have to listen to those words just once more.”
I didn’t doubt Keisei and the others had been trying to persuade him
when I wasn’t around. And yet, Kouenji hadn’t budged a single inch.
“You don’t have to get an outstanding score. Just do what you’re
supposed to.”
“You do not get to decide that. I do. You know that, don’t you? I will
see you later,” said Kouenji, motioning that he was about to leave. But I
grabbed his arm and stopped him.
He tried to take a step forward, leaving me no choice but to hold fast
and dig in my heels. I expected him to resist, but for some reason Kouenji
went slack.
“Heh. I see. So that’s how it is then, Ayanokouji Boy,” said Kouenji,
turning toward me.
“What do you mean? What’s how what is?”
“The person who tamed the Dragon Boy.”
“Dragon…who?”
“I’m talking about that mischievous rascal, Ryuuen.”
“What does Ryuuen have to do with me?”
“You’re quite good at playing dumb. You don’t let your intentions slip
through at all when you feign indifference.”
“I really don’t understand how you arrived at this conclusion.”
“Because of your touch on my arm. I can tell by the heat being
transmitted through your skin.”
I’d already figured Kouenji wasn’t normal, but apparently he was even
more of an eccentric than I was. He got all that from me grabbing his arm?
“Sorry, but this is a huge misunderstanding,” I said.
“Really? Judging by the way Delinquent-kun looks at you and acts
around you, and the reactions of all those around you, I would think it’s a
certifiable fact.”
Kouenji didn’t have a single shred of evidence, but he sounded
overwhelmingly confident in his observations. It’d be pointless to attempt
149
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
any further deception.
“Heh. Relax. I have no intention of revealing what you’re keeping
hidden. Even if you do happen to be exceptional in your own way, you’re
still a small fry to me. One of many. So, whether I’m right or wrong, there
should be no problem as long as I don’t spill the beans. Correct?”
“Well, I do want to clear up this misunderstanding.”
“Too bad. That’s not going to happen, Ayanokouji Boy. Even if you
have third parties vouch for you, assuring me that you had nothing to do with
any of it, my mind is made up. I’m certain of what I know.”
“I see. Well, can we get back to the matter at hand?”
“You’re talking about me doing my part as a member of the group,
yes?”
“Can you?”
“I’ve said this repeatedly. I refuse.”
He answered clearly and decisively.
“I will act in accordance with my own wishes. That is my philosophy.
Will I take the exam, or won’t I? What grade will I achieve? All of those
things depend on how I feel in that moment.”
“I see.”
I had considered various means of persuasion, but haphazardly trying
anything out here would probably backfire. I was going to have to leave
things to chance, but there was a strong possibility that doing so would cause
the least harm. It was clear as day that Kouenji wanted to avoid being
punished with expulsion. I had no choice but to gamble on that.
There was nothing I could do for now but watch Kouenji walk away,
chasing the wild boar.
“I don’t think there’s anyone in the world who can make that guy do
anything.”
It didn’t matter if it was Horikita’s brother, or Nagumo, or even his
own classmates. Such was my honest impression of my classmate, whom I
had known for about a year now.
150

6.2
 
AFTER LEAVING KOUENJI, I returned to the course. Even though I’d
been gone for less than ten minutes, I was probably in last place now. I didn’t
see any students from the group in front of or behind me, so I decided to rush
a bit and catch up. A short while later, I sighted a group of first-year students
—Keisei and the other guys. Tokitou noticed me first right away, and then
everyone else looked over to me.
“Well, for the record, I did find him, but…”
“No dice, huh?”
Hashimoto, who predicted that would happen, wore a bitter smile on
his face. The other students didn’t blame me either and just groused about
Kouenji’s absence. Somehow or other, we eventually made it to the
turnaround point, happily badmouthing Kouenji as we went. Chabashira was
waiting for us there, arms crossed. I hadn’t seen her in a few days, but it
seemed she’d been tapped pretty regularly to help out with various lessons.
“The second-years and third-years have turned back. You guys are all
that’s left,” she said.
“What time is it, sensei?”
“It’s almost eleven o’clock now.”
That meant we still had an hour to go until our lunch break. If this were
a flat road, it wouldn’t be too hard to make it back in time. However, we had
already trudged nine kilometers up an incredibly steep, winding slope. Our
stamina had been depleted considerably. If we didn’t run at a solid pace, this
exercise was going to take a bite out of our lunch break.
“I’m going on ahead. I don’t want to be late for lunch.”
“Wait. We’ll be taking roll call before you head back down. Each
person has to state their class and name.”
A board was brought out, probably for the purposes of recorded
students who’d made it to the turnaround point. Once Ishizaki signed, he
turned on his heel and ran, leaving the group behind. Looked like it would be
151
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
every man for himself, group be damned. Albert followed afterward.
“Let’s go, Kiyotaka.”
“You go on ahead. I’d like to wait and make sure Kouenji comes
back.”
“That’s all well and good, but…we only have an hour left.”
“I’m fast enough. Don’t worry.”
“Short-distance running and long-distance running are two different
things, you know. Well, I guess I’m not really one to talk,” said Keisei,
letting out a self-derisive chuckle before running awkwardly.
“I’m going,” said Hashimoto.
“Yep.”
Hashimoto, the last member of our group, stretched and then ran off.
Chabashira and I were the only two people left.
“It doesn’t seem like you have anything you want to discuss with me,”
she said.
“I’m just waiting for Kouenji. If we don’t get the tail end moving, it’ll
be trouble.”
“Trouble?”
It wasn’t really a big deal. If you had stamina to spare, like Ishizaki,
who was quick to take the lead and clear the race, you’d never notice the
students who gave up partway through. This wasn’t a timed trial. We just had
to clear the course by the set time; whether we did that in one hour or four
didn’t matter. Keisei didn’t have much stamina himself, but it was obvious he
was pushing himself hard to keep from holding us back.
About twenty minutes later, Kouenji finally showed up.
“This seems to be the turnaround.”
He’d gotten around a bit, apparently. Traces of leaves and dirt were
stuck to his jersey.
“You’re the last one, Kouenji. You have forty minutes left.”
“That seems to be the case. I wish I’d taken my time a bit more, but my
encounter with the wild boar ended a bit sooner than expected.”
152
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Wild boar?” asked Chabashira.
She clearly had questions about that particularly strange and sudden
part of what he’d just said, but Kouenji turned around and ran off.
“Roll call, Kouenji. You’ll be disqualified otherwise,” said Chabashira.
“My name is Kouenji Rokusuke. Remember it well, teacher,” said
Kouenji, without even turning around. His boisterous laughter echoed down
the hill.
“Is that okay, sensei? He didn’t state his class.”
“Well, he gave his name. Let’s cut him some slack.”
“All right. I’ll be heading off myself.”
I wondered how much time had passed. Coming up on the sign
warning us about wild boars again, I saw two male students’ backs. One of
them was Keisei, about what I’d expected. Rather than having exhausted his
stamina, though, he seemed to be leaning on another student, who was
propping him up. It looked like his left leg was hurt.
The other student was Hashimoto, who, as I’d anticipated, had stayed
back to help pull Keisei along. As I ran over to them, the situation became
clear.
“Did you get a sprain?”
“Ayanokouji? Yeah, looks that way. I’m guessing his ankle was at its
limit by the turnaround point,” said Hashimoto, explaining on Keisei’s
behalf.
It had to be tough to support another person’s weight, but he didn’t
seem to mind. He walked slowly, close to Keisei, and didn’t seem displeased
whatsoever.
“Ugh, I’m so pathetic. Why can’t I even do something like this?”
Keisei seemed frustrated, but I could still tell he’d changed. The old
Keisei had found it hard to comprehend physical sports or anything other
than written exams; he’d thought a student’s life and work centered on
academics. This Keisei had stretched before resuming the downward trek,
and he’d gone last for the same reason I had.
“I’ll help too,” I said.
153
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Two would be better for this job than one. I went to the other side and
supported Keisei.
“Wait. If you do this, you’ll both be late for lunch,” said Keisei.
“If we just abandon you, you’ll start running, won’t you? You’d hurt
your leg even more. That would spell trouble for all of us when the final test
comes around. If we can ease your injury just by missing out on one lunch
break, that’s a small price to pay. Right, Ayanokouji?”
“You’re probably right about that.”
“But…”
“It was just good timing that the two of us were running near you,” I
said. “Don’t feel embarrassed.”
Hashimoto corrected me. “Three of us, actually. Although, man, that
Kouenji dude runs insanely fast, huh? Dude’s a monster.”
“I get the feeling he has limitless stamina. There’s no doubt he’s
number one in our grade level.” I wasn’t flattering Kouenji, just being honest.
“Maybe his horrible personality saved us from being saddled with
Kouenji in Class A. Being in a group with him has made it pretty clear that
he’s an inconvenience for Class C, rather than an asset.”
It was true that if Kouenji ever utilized his full potential, he’d be a
huge threat. I couldn’t say he made a good secret weapon if he wouldn’t
cooperate, though.
In the end, it was around 12:40 by the time we got back to camp,
carrying the injured Keisei between us. After we arrived, Keisei got medical
treatment at the infirmary. Hashimoto and I waited for him in the corridor.
About ten minutes later, Keisei returned.
“How is it?” asked Hashimoto. Keisei smiled bitterly.
“It’s just a light sprain. Thanks to the two of you, it ended up being a
minor injury.”
While he was favoring his left leg a bit, it did seem like he was walking
pretty normally.
“There’s not much time until the exam. Don’t let it get any worse,”
said Hashimoto, lightly patting Keisei on the shoulder.
154
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Hey, I know you helped me out, but…” said Keisei. Hashimoto
immediately understood.
“Don’t worry about it. We’ll keep this between us. That’ll be more
convenient, right?”
He’d gotten what Keisei was trying to say without having to hear it put
in words. Keisei patted his chest and let out a sigh of relief.
155

SINCE I MISSED LUNCH, I was more excited than usual for dinner. After
nabbing my seat, I immediately started eating.
“Hey, Kiyopon, the seat next to you free?”
That was Haruka’s voice. When I turned around, I saw that all of the
members of the Ayanokouji Group were together.
“Sheesh, Kiyopon. We’ve had a hard time trying to find you these past
few days. You’ve been in weirdly difficult places to spot.”
“Sorry. I guess I just don’t know what to do in a cafeteria this huge.”
Because of the way the groups were set up, it wasn’t that easy to get
the usual crew together. Since there weren’t enough seats here, we moved a
bit to find a spot where all five of us could sit.
“I-It’s certainly been a while, hasn’t it, Kiyotaka-kun?” said Airi
bashfully.
It certainly was unusual for us not to talk for almost a full week. Even
during the long holidays, we’d call or meet up.
“More importantly, you doing okay, Miyacchi? You’re with Ryuuen,
right?” Haruka asked, directing her question at Akito. She must have heard
about that from somewhere.
“Well, I guess. I’m keeping my guard up, but it doesn’t seem there’s
been any change. He’s actually taking the classes seriously and
participating.”
“Like, even zazen and the relay?”
“Yeah. He’s acting so normal, it’s almost scary. If anything, he’s
handling himself way better than the awkward guys. It’s just, well, I’ve tried
talking to him a few times, but he doesn’t seem to want to hang out with
anyone.”
“Maybe he kind of went crazy from the shock of losing a fight?”
“I dunno. I think this is just the way he’s always been.”
156
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Akito braced himself, as if saying that he couldn’t drop his guard.
“Anyway, how about you? Are you getting along well with your
group?”
“Not much to say, personally. I’m not close with anyone in it, but I’m
not fighting with anyone either. Airi and I are in the same group, so I’m
good.”
“I’m really glad that Haruka-chan is there for me.”
So Haruka and Airi were in the same group? It must be reassuring to
have even one close friend with you.
“It seems like our group has the most problems, Kiyotaka.”
“You might be right about that.”
“Really?”
Haruka and Airi exchanged looks, like this was the first they were
hearing about it.
“Well, Kouenji won’t follow orders, and Ishizaki snaps at people at the
drop of a hat. Maybe it’s because he has Albert with him, but we can’t
control him either. They’re a pain in the neck.”
“So Kouenji-kun is with you too… Are you all right, Kiyotaka-kun?”
“He’s not actively harming us or anything.”
“If anything, I’d say Ishizaki’s the real problem child. Maybe he’s
gotten carried away since Ryuuen-kun was defeated. Not so long ago, he was
just a lackey.”
To tell the truth, I felt like one of the main reasons for Ishizaki’s bad
behavior was being put in the same group as me. I imagined feeling all this
anger and frustration that he had no outlet for was causing him to lash out at
anyone who wasn’t me.
“In any case, I have to work hard as the representative,” said Keisei.
Even with the metaphorical equivalent of a bomb strapped to his leg, he kept
doing his best to unite the group.
“You boys sure have it rough, huh?”
“S-somehow, I feel like we’re kind of out of place.”
157
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Come on, it’s all right. I mean, if you girls are doing okay, that puts us
at ease. Right?” said Akito.
True enough. Even with Kei funneling me information on the girls,
there were still plenty of areas I couldn’t see. If Haruka and Airi were
together and moving along without issue, we boys could focus more on
ourselves.

IT WAS NOW the sixth day, Tuesday. On that day, I started to hear
something a little odd from the guys.
They missed the opposite sex.
That was the current topic of conversation. I got the feeling that most
of them were looking forward to dinnertime. While being surrounded by guys
made me feel more relaxed, it wasn’t exactly as fun.
“Agh, goddamn it. I feel like I’m losin’ my mind being around guys all
the time.”
“If I were at an all-guys’ school, I’d be dead, man.”
Those were just some of the opinions I heard.
“Dude, havin’ only guys around stinks. Like, literally.”
I supposed it was inevitable that they were buying into the cliché that
all guys had bad hygiene. The truth, however, was that there weren’t many
sweaty or smelly people here. They should be thankful this wasn’t
summertime. And, well…personally, I felt more relaxed being around only
guys. That fact bore repeating.
“Ow, my hip…”
While we were in the middle of dusting, Keisei yelped in pain and
crouched down. We had cleaning and breakfast duty to deal with every day,
regardless of the lessons that continued at the same time, and we’d reached
the point where you could see the weaker students starting to hit their limits.
Keisei was complaining about his pain.
The area we’d been assigned to clean today was pretty big, forcing
everyone in our group, which was already short-staffed to begin with, to
work harder than usual. When even one person got injured, you had to make
up for it.
“Whaddya mean, your hips hurt? Do your job.”
Ishizaki grabbed Keisei’s arm and forcefully yanked him up.
159
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“I-I know. I’ll do the work. Let go.”
“Then do it right,” spat Ishizaki, before heading back.
Keisei immediately tried to resume cleaning, but he just wasn’t moving
well. His sprained leg in particular was clearly stiff.
“Ugh.”
He grunted quietly. He seemed to be enduring the pain, but if he
pushed himself too hard, it’d affect him tomorrow.
“Grab a breather. I’ll take your spot.” There was no helping it. I’d
clean Keisei’s section for him.
“Sorry, Kiyotaka.”
“Hey, we help each other out when we’re in trouble.”
Problem solved.
Until…
“Hey. You just said you’d do it yourself!” said Ishizaki.
Apparently he didn’t like that I was lending Keisei a hand. But he still
made sure not to meet my eyes.
“I’ll handle it,” I replied.
Ishizaki didn’t seem satisfied. He looked right through me, continuing
to rain harsh words on Keisei.
“You’re the representative, ain’t you? Don’t bitch about somethin’ like
cleaning.”
“I get it.”
Keisei felt responsible. When pressed, he’d fold.
“You don’t get it. You’re tryin’ to push your job onto someone else
right now, aren’t you? I don’t like that. Do it yourself.”
“…I get it. I’ll do it.”
“All right then, there you have it. Do not, under any circumstance, give
him a hand, Ayanokouji.”
Ishizaki spoke to me for the first time, then immediately backed away,
as if he was making his escape.
160

“Even if Keisei injures himself as a result?” I asked.
“If he gets injured, that’s that,” answered Ishizaki.
Apparently, Ishizaki wouldn’t permit any attempt to help Keisei, even
though he knew it wasn’t good for the group. Albert silently approached
Ishizaki, looking as though he was trying to tell him something. But Ishizaki
didn’t seem to be listening.
“Sorry, Kiyotaka. Guess I have no choice but to hang in there.”
Keisei probably feared the group’s mood would worsen if he didn’t
keep working. Ishizaki was already riled by Keisei’s attitude over the past
few days; he probably couldn’t stand Keisei having someone else helping
him out. Keisei understood that, which was precisely because he took
Ishizaki’s warning to heart and decided to do the job himself.
Still, if Keisei pushed himself too hard, we might pay for it later. Even
if he held out today, there was no telling what tomorrow would bring. The
actual exam included multiple physically demanding tests, like zazen and the
long-distance relay. He might suffer even more than he did now. I wanted to
make Ishizaki understand, but I doubted it’d be simple.
“Hey, Ishizaki. You’re taking this a little too far,” said Yahiko, unable
to just sit back and watch the situation play out.
“It’s his own fault for not being able to clean properly,” said Ishizaki.
“I know that. But what about him? Go warn him too.” Yahiko pointed
at Kouenji, who had never once cleaned anything at all.
“I can’t even communicate with that dude in Japanese. I ain’t got time
to persuade a gorilla,” replied Ishizaki.
It wasn’t as though Ishizaki hadn’t warned Kouenji at least once
before. He’d confronted him many times, to no avail, and given up. In that
sense, you could say that the difference between Keisei and Kouenji was that
Ishizaki was able to have an actual conversation with Keisei.
“If you have a problem, then you try and argue with him. It’ll just be a
waste of time, though.”
“Fine. If I have to go, I’ll go,” said Yahiko, grabbing a broom and
walking over to Kouenji.
161
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“It’s pointless. You’ll see.”
Ishizaki gave a derisive snort. Yahiko thrust the broom at Kouenji,
trying to press him to clean. But after a few minutes, he walked away, totally
exhausted. We might be in the same group, but we were all still enemies.
Clearly, that hadn’t changed.
Most of the students probably wanted this group activity to end as soon
as possible. But the important thing to remember was that not every group
was like ours. Even if it was only on the surface for now, some groups had to
have members who were deepening ties with one another, forming real
friendships and alliances, as if they were actually classmates. It wasn’t just
the first-years either. The same phenomenon could be observed among the
upperclassmen who had managed to stabilize the relationships between their
classes. They understood that everyone benefited if they cooperated.
Some students could plan ahead, while others were slaves to their
darker impulses. Without a drastic gulf in skill to shake things up, it wasn’t
difficult to imagine the outcome of this battle.
“Aagh! I don’t wanna do this! This is just so friggin’ dumb! Why do
we even gotta play nice? Pretend like we’re friends with dudes from the other
classes? Right, Albert?”
Albert didn’t agree or disagree, but Ishizaki continued.
“Seriously, dude. I hate this group so friggin’ much, I could die.
There’s that gorilla Kouenji, and the annoying loudmouth Yukimura who
talks a big game even though he can’t even run a friggin’ marathon. Then
there’s those Class B dudes who just smile and laugh without a care in the
world, and those do-nothin’ Class A jerks. Idiotic.”
WHACK! Ishizaki kicked the broom.
“You’re free to curse us all you want, but keep cleaning.”
“Shut up. Kouenji ain’t doin’ nothin’, so why do I gotta?”
“Then you have no right to say anything to Yukimura, do you?” said
Hashimoto.
But Ishizaki wasn’t listening. He abandoned his cleaning duties and
left, muttering something about going to the bathroom. Keisei bit his lip,
frustrated.
162
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Keisei, you need to stop trying to shoulder everything alone. You
can’t change anything in the one or two days we have left. If you make an
error in judgment now, you might regret it later,” I said, giving Keisei some
advice…or rather, hoping to confirm that he understood me.
“I understand, but there’s nothing else I can do. If I lean on someone
else for help, Ishizaki will just alienate the rest of the group even further. If I
do nothing, it’s highly likely that our group will come in last place. So I have
to do something, even if it’s reckless.”
If the two options Keisei had just listed were the only options
available, then acting recklessly probably would be the better choice. If you
had no other paths to take, you just had to forge a new one for yourself. But
Keisei didn’t seem capable of forging anything right now, let alone a whole
new option.
We needed someone who was capable of both understanding the group
and also taking action for the sake of others. I looked over at Hashimoto, who
was quietly continuing to clean. He’d stopped Ishizaki from snapping at
Kouenji on the second day, and he’d responded perfectly to the situation
during the marathon practice. I had the impression he could to hold the group
together firmly, at the right distance.
It was unclear how much Sakayanagi and Katsuragi valued him, but I
imagined he was a highly capable man—if I evaluated him as a hypothetical
enemy, anyway. He was harder to read than the aggressive Sakayanagi and
the conservative Katsuragi, which made him a tougher opponent.
“Look, just don’t forget that I’m here. If you’re in trouble, I’ll help.”
“Thank you, Kiyotaka. Just hearing you say that puts me at ease.”
If those words helped Keisei, I was happy to say them.

6.5
 
DURING OUR NEXT CLASS, it was clear the situation in our group had
not improved. Keisei, feeling responsible, couldn’t successfully give orders
as the representative, and Ishizaki wouldn’t even talk to anyone except Albert
anymore. Even during mealtime, the only period when it was possible to
create some kind of peace and harmony, our group never came together.
I decided to forget about them for the time being. There was nothing I
could do for this group, anyway. I could give some advice to the struggling
Keisei and the belligerent Ishizaki, but I had no intention of taking any direct
action to help. Getting in deeper would defeat the purpose of trying to fade
into the background.
Remembering Haruka and Airi, I decided to investigate what was
going on with the girls again. However, it wasn’t like I could just keep
directly contacting Kei over and over again. She had responsibilities of her
own, and if I kept contacting her, it might cause others to have their
suspicions about the nature of our relationship.
Besides, the information I wanted wasn’t related to the first-years. I
wanted information on the second- and third- years. I needed to confirm
Nagumo’s true intentions toward Horikita’s brother.
This meant my number of helpful contacts was very limited indeed. I
took a small risk for that reason, attempting to contact Kiriyama by leaving a
clue for him to find…but Kiriyama was in Nagumo’s group. Even if he
resented Nagumo, he probably couldn’t help me this time.
I had to attack from a direction Nagumo didn’t expect. One person
came to mind. I had Kei investigate a certain second-year girl for me.
That person was named Asahina Nazuna.
She was in Class A, alongside Nagumo Miyabi, and was personally
quite close with him. I’d seen Asahina eating meals with her friends in the
cafeteria many times. Even now, I was monitoring her movements from afar.
She wasn’t on the student council but had a relatively high level of influence
within her class. She also seemed to have a lot of influence over Nagumo.
164
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
There were other guys and girls who were close to Nagumo, but I
chose Asahina for two reasons. The first was that, contrary to her rough
exterior and way of speaking, she had a reputation for being dutiful and
conscientious. She also didn’t worship Nagumo.
The other reason was that the two of us had just so happened to bump
into one another by accident. The difficulty in trying to dig up information on
Nagumo came from the fact that virtually every single second-year supported
him. If I clumsily attempted to make contact, I ran the risk of exposing
information about myself instead.
I had to narrow my possible contacts down to someone who was least
likely to leak information. This made our “accidental” meeting a powerful
weapon. Information that only I know. Information that only Asahina could
understand. I would use what that accident had birthed.
What accident do I mean? Well, it came from a good luck charm.
Asahina had accidentally lost it a while back, and I had just so
happened to pick it up. At the time, I’d returned it without thinking much of
it. To my surprise, though, the item was apparently very important to her. I
could tell because she had brought it with her even to this camp. She always
wore it on her person, with great care.
An accidental connection can sometimes be stronger than one created
intentionally. Taking advantage of that connection, I wanted to ascertain
whether or not she could be a useful source of information regarding
Nagumo. The very circumstances of this camp made contacting her easy. All
that remained was how to change our indirect connection into a direct one.
If I openly approached Asahina, then someone—even if it wasn’t
Asahina herself—might report it back to Nagumo. I wanted to avoid that. I’d
been waiting for the right time, but Asahina spent almost all of her dinner
hours with other people. I couldn’t find a chance to be alone with her.
But today, that golden opportunity finally presented itself.
“I’m going to the bathroom. Be right back.”
Just like that, Asahina got up, mid-meal. No other students
accompanied her as she left, which was strange for a girl. I quickly followed
her. I couldn’t bother her while she was in the bathroom, so I patiently waited
for her to come back out.
165
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
We’d probably have five minutes to talk at most. If I took up much
more of her time, she might grow annoyed. I had no idea how much I could
get done within those five minutes, but I had to remind her that we’d met
earlier by chance. Emphasis on chance.
Soon, Asahina exited the bathroom. As usual, she was wearing her
charm on her left wrist.
I pretended to be passing by.
“Hmm?” I muttered, quietly enough that Asahina might have thought I
was just saying that to myself or that I was calling out to her.
When I said that, Asahina turned around. If I didn’t respond quickly,
she would probably think I’d been talking to myself and keep on walking. I
decided to act.
“Oh, sorry. I was just thinking I’d seen that charm before. Please don’t
mind me,” I said, motioning as if to continue walking. If she didn’t respond, I
was prepared to start a conversation myself.
“They don’t sell this charm at the school anymore, though,” she
replied.
But she did reply, so without hesitating, I kept the conversation going.
“Oh, that so? Did you happen to drop it a while back, by any chance?”
I asked. She should understand what I meant right away.
“Wait, are you…the person who found my charm?” she asked.
“Maybe… I picked it up on my way back to the dorm, uh…when was
that, again?” I replied, pretending not to remember.
“No, I think I’m right. I see. So it was you,” said Asahina, smiling
happily. She drew nearer. “Thank you. When I realized I’d lost it, I was so
upset. Ever since then, I’ve been scared I’ll lose it again, so I’ve been
wearing it more often.”
She looked bashfully at her wrist.
“This charm, well, I bought it after I started school. It’s not like I have
any strong attachment to it in itself or anything. It’s just…how do I put it?
It’s like emotional support. When I have it at hand, I just feel safer, you
know? When I lose it, I get all anxious that something bad is going to happen,
166
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
like it’s a bad omen or something. I was so relieved that someone found it.”
Well, bringing good luck was essentially a charm’s purpose.
“I never imagined you’d be the one who found it.”
“Do you know me?” I asked.
“Yeah, I know about you. You got a lot of attention in that relay race
against Horikita-senpai. Oh, and Miyabi. Wait, you might not know his first
name. Student Council President Nagumo talked to you a while back, right?”
“Wait. Were you there too?” I asked.
Of course, I knew the answer to that. Ichinose had also been present.
“Well, yeah.”
Asahina seemed like the person who’d put up her guard if I told her I
knew she’d been there, so I pretended not to remember. Just like picking up
her charm, this meeting, where we just happened to cross paths, had to be
accidental too.
“I’m pretty fast, but to be honest I don’t really have anything else
going for me. Maybe I’ve caught President Nagumo’s eye through some kind
of misunderstanding,” I told her, making my voice sound troubled. Asahina
nodded back repeatedly, showing that she understood.
“Nagumo really respects Horikita-senpai. Or, like, he’s made Horikita-
senpai a sort of goal. I think he was probably jealous that he didn’t get to
challenge him during the relay.”
I couldn’t sense any ulterior motive in Asahina’s words. For better or
worse, she seemed the honest type. I decided to step things up a bit.
“How can I get Nagumo-senpai to stop paying attention to me?” I
asked.
“Well, how about you beat him at something? You could cut that smug
Miyabi down to size. Personally, I’d love to see him lose for once,” she
replied, chuckling. She was probably joking, but I pretended to take what she
said at face value.
167
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
168
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“I see. That might be one option,” I replied.
Asahina’s eyes immediately darted back to me, an awestruck look on
her face. Then a few seconds after, she burst into laughter.
“Ah ha ha ha! Come on, I was joking. Couldn’t you tell?” she asked,
laughing almost to the point of tears, lightly smacking me on the shoulder.
“So if Nagumo’s ever defeated, that would be trouble, huh?” I said.
Just in case she still thought I was joking, I decided to strengthen my
tone. If Asahina was the type of person who would pull back and report to
Nagumo now, then this was the end of the line. Even if she reported back to
him, it’d end with her thinking that I was just some uppity first-year.
“Wait, are you serious?” she asked.
“So you were joking, senpai?” I replied.
“Hey, look. This isn’t something a first-year can do anything about,”
she replied, apologizing for joking around. But I continued speaking in the
same tone.
“Among all the second-years I’ve met until now, you seem to be the
most straightforward one, Asahina-senpai.”
“The most straightforward?”
“It’s hard to get any information from the second-years, outside of
‘Nagumo Miyabi rules us all.’”
“That’s some dangerous talk. I’m a second-year too, you know. Miyabi
and I have a pretty deep relationship, understand?” she replied.
“It’s not about being shallow or deep. What matters is how much
you’ve been influenced by him.”
Since they were in the same class, they couldn’t be enemies, not truly.
No matter what Asahina privately thought of Nagumo, she wouldn’t want her
class to suffer for it.
“I think those are similar things, though,” she said.
“In that case, think of this as nonsense from a first-year.” I bowed.
“Please excuse me.”
“Ah, wait. Somehow, I feel like I’m the bad guy here,” she replied,
169
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
releasing a deep sigh. Her smile disappeared. “I see you’re not joking around.
As an apology, please let me repay you for picking up my charm. If there’s
anything you’d like to know, I’ll tell you.”
“Are you sure? It might be seen as rebelling against Nagumo-senpai,
you know.”
“To be honest, I don’t think anything drastic will happen just because I
talk to you,” she replied.
She seemed to be certain that telling me something about what was
going on with the second-years wouldn’t have a major impact. In other
words, anything she told me would be information that didn’t matter, even if
it was leaked.
“Out of the girls in your grade level, how many would you say are
especially close with Nagumo-senpai?” I asked.
“Girls who are close with him? Like, all of them. They trust Miyabi
more than other guys, y’know.”
I already knew he was no ordinary opponent, but this was an
extraordinarily broad range of skills.
“What about the people who act as Nagumo-senpai’s eyes and ears?” I
asked.
“You really think I’d tell you that?”
“Well, as a senpai, it’s okay to help a first-year out a bit, right?”
“Wow, you’re cheeky,” she replied, laughing. She didn’t seem upset,
though. “Well, if I do say so myself, the second-years have a really strong
sense of unity. Honestly, we were more successful at dividing into groups
than the first- and the third-years, you know? After they explained the test to
us back on the bus, Miyabi said to immediately share that information with
the other classes.”
As I’d suspected—though they’d started out as enemies, the four
second-year classes seemed on the way to becoming actual allies. Asahina
told me the names of the four class representatives. The four classes kept in
contact with one another and had even discussed the formation of their small
groups with each other, to a certain degree. Apparently things had gone
similarly for the girls.
170
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“What about when you met up with the first- and third-year groups?
Did you decide things randomly then too?”
Nagumo had proposed a draft selection system, which the first-year
guys had carried out.
“For the most part, yeah.”
“For the most part. So something was different?”
Asahina crossed her arms, appearing deep in thought.
“Why do you ask?”
I could tell Asahina was starting to have doubts. The silence lingered.
“Are you not going to tell me?” I asked.
“No, I will. It’s just…when we were deciding on the large groups,
some of the second-year girls made a small request. Or more like…they
wanted some adjustments. At that time, the small group was made up of
members that Miyabi could count on.”
If the group formed based on Nagumo’s orders, then he’d likely given
them a special role. You wouldn’t think that unless you knew what was going
on within the second-years. From an outsider’s perspective, it would simply
look like friends coming together.
“Are there any first- or third-years who were selected to join that girls’
large group that stand out in particular?”
“Even if you ask me that, I hardly know anything about the first-years.
From the third-years, I guess there’s Tachibana-senpai, who was Horikita-
senpai’s secretary. Ah, but their representative is a different person, though.
Miyabi said nothing weird would happen. He said he was going to do this fair
and square.”
“You have a lot of faith in Nagumo-senpai, huh?”
Horikita’s brother also seemed to place a certain degree of trust in what
Nagumo said. If I were to believe him and Asahina, then this line of
reasoning might be considered a feint. Nagumo had promised to fight fair and
square, but at the same time, he was making us jump at shadows. We feared
he might be up to something behind the scenes, and he was using that to
break our concentration.
171
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“He always sticks to his word. He won’t use dirty tricks. Besides, even
if that group of girls does try to lay some kind of trap, it won’t have any
effect on Horikita-senpai and Miyabi’s fight.”
“That’s right. It would be completely irrelevant.”
Asahina was spot-on. Nagumo had proposed that only his group and
Horikita’s brother’s group compete. The girls had nothing to do with it. Even
if some of the second-year girls who were close with Nagumo happened to be
in Tachibana’s large group, it was irrelevant.
So was he making it look like he had something underhanded going on,
while actually fighting above the board? That would mean the seemingly
meaningful words he’d uttered when he met up with the third-year student
from his group, Ishikura-senpai, were just a fake-out too.
I supposed that if you were investigating him normally, you’d get the
sense that these clues were popping up and then disappearing all over the
place. An interesting way of doing things. This was different from
Sakayanagi and Ryuuen: a unique strategy.
“What I can tell you, I suppose, is that whoever cares too much is the
one who loses.”
“You were a big help,” I said.
I was grateful to Asahina for humoring my unreasonable request to
discuss her class’s internal affairs. Of course, she’d probably done so because
she didn’t think I could be an obstacle for Miyabi. She couldn’t even imagine
me being his opponent.
“Well, do your best to try and give Miyabi a run for his money, boy,”
Asahina. “I’ll be rooting for you, even if it’s only a little bit.”
“Oh, just one more thing…”
“Hmm?”
If I combined what I’d just learned with the information I got from Kei,
my understanding of the situation was becoming much clearer. I decided to
push a little harder.
172
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
6.6
 
ON THE NIGHT of the sixth day, a sour mood hung over the entire
group. If we let the day end like this, the group might fall apart entirely
tomorrow. These rancor between us would just continue to intensify, making
it all the harder to secure a high score on the test that was now just two days
away.
Returning to the room after my bath, I found the atmosphere tense as
ever. Ishizaki had walled himself off and was now refusing to speak to
anyone else. Keisei, blaming himself, had fallen silent and retreated inward
too. The Class B students kept trying to chat in an attempt to liven things up,
but the awkward atmosphere was too much for them to bear, and they
eventually went silent.
Eventually, after confirming that it was getting close to lights-out time,
Yahiko flipped the switch and sent the room into darkness, seeking to bring
this day to a merciful end.
“Hey, Ishizaki. You got a minute?” Hashimoto broke the long silence
as we sat in the pitch darkness.
“No,” replied Ishizaki.
Judging from the sound of rustling sheets that followed, he’d probably
turned his back to Hashimoto, refusing to engage.
“At this rate, our group will be in extreme danger. We have the
advantage of our team not being too big, but that also disadvantages us when
it comes to the exam itself. In the worst-case scenario, Yukimura and
someone else will be expelled,” said Hashimoto.
You’re going to be the one who goes down with him when that
happens, Ishizaki. You know that? was the unsaid implication.
“Shut it. Even if I get expelled, whatever. I don’t care. Shit happens.”
“Dude, come on…” Hashimoto sighed deeply, as if giving up, at this
refusal of his helping hand.
I couldn’t see Hashimoto’s face in the darkness. Had we passed the
173
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
point of no return when it came to our group’s unity? Maybe it was time we
gave up.
“I played soccer in elementary school and junior high. Our school was
pretty prestigious, so our team competed in national championships each
year. I wasn’t an ace player or anything, but I played in most games and did
pretty well,” said Hashimoto. He didn’t direct the words to any one person in
particular but addressed the room as a whole.
“Wait, you’re not part of the soccer team now though, are you? It
doesn’t look like you got injured or anything,” Yahiko pointed out, his voice
cutting through the dark.
“No, I’m not. I know it’s not really popular these days, but I used to
smoke.”
“So they found you out and kicked you out of soccer?”
“No. I hid my smoking habit well. Only my family knew.”
“Even if smoking is disgusting, it’s not a reason to quit soccer.”
Yahiko’s doubts were justified. If no one had known, then it couldn’t
have been an issue.
“I guess I just felt this sense of alienation or something. Everyone else
would be working together to win the national championships, and part of me
would just kind of observe them coldly. I knew I didn’t belong. Also, I didn’t
really like soccer all that much. I decided to quit playing and just focus on my
studies. I was pretty smart to begin with, so it wasn’t that hard to keep getting
good grades.”
“What, now you’re bragging? I ain’t listenin’ to this,” interjected
Ishizaki nastily.
“For better or worse, my only saving grace was that I could do
reasonably well out in the world, I suppose. But there are still times when I
feel regret. Whenever I see Hirata and Shibata practicing out on the field, I
think it could have been me out there. Even though I didn’t even like it that
much. Strange, huh?” said Hashimoto.
He chuckled self-deprecatingly to himself. “What about you? What
was your childhood like, Ishizaki?” asked Hashimoto.
“Huh? Why you askin’?”
174
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“No reason.”
“Hmph. Well, I ain’t got anything to say.” Ishizaki refused, to no one’s
shock.
Keisei opened his mouth, the next to join our conversation in the
darkness.
“Ever since I was little, all I ever did was study. Maybe I was
influenced by my older sister. She was a lot older than me, and she wanted to
be a teacher, which meant I always had to play the role of the student. My
sister was pretty ridiculous. She was always giving me these stupidly difficult
problems to solve, even when I was in elementary school.”
“So that’s why you’re so good at studying, huh?” replied Hashimoto,
responding as though he were trying to draw out the conversation.
“Yeah. And on top of that, I’m terrible at sports. No matter what I did,
I generally came in near last place, just barely squeaking by. I decided to just
focus on developing my strengths rather than conquering my weaknesses.
I used to think there was no point in training your body if you weren’t
planning to become a professional athlete. Enrolling in this school made me
begin to doubt that for the first time…but I still believed that I could study
hard and be considered an appropriate pick for Class A,” said Keisei.
He stopped speaking for a moment, as if he were remembering that
time. Being put in Class D must have caused him immense despair.
“But then all these things I couldn’t accept just kept happening. I don’t
agree with the solidarity system, and living on the deserted island made even
less sense to me… In my own class, Sudou was like the polar opposite of me.
He was great at sports, but he couldn’t study. At first, I thought I’d been
saddled with some ridiculous baggage. But on the uninhabited island and
during the Sports Festival, Sudou’s skills were far more useful than mine.
I could see him shine, right beside me.”
There was a hint of regret in his voice.
“There’s still a part of me that can’t accept it, to be honest. But I’m
slowly beginning to realize that if all you can do is study, or all you can do is
sports, then that’s no good. That’s the thing about this exam. If you can’t do
both of those things, then you can’t score high. Am I wrong? Ishizaki?”
175
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Seriously, are you askin’ me—?”
“I feel completely humiliated. Just like back on the uninhabited island
and during the Sports Festival. I’m dragging the group down. I hurt myself,
which has meant being a burden on others, and more importantly, I dragged
down the group’s morale. I have absolutely nothing to show Ishizaki, who,
despite his complaints, has been contributing to the group just as much if not
more than the average.”
Ishizaki seemed about to mock him, but then he swallowed his swords.
I couldn’t see his face. But it was precisely because we were in the darkness,
unable to see each other, that we could be this vulnerable.
“I’m sorry, Ishizaki… I’m sorry that your representative, who should
be setting an example for the rest of you, is in this condition.”
I could tell Keisei was trying to hold back tears. None of us were
insensitive enough to cut in and say something. These were bitter tears.
“Stop screwing around. Why are you apologizing? I mean, I’m the one
who blamed you,” said Ishizaki. He let loose a chuckle, seemingly aimed at
himself, before continuing on. “I mean, you were the one who agreed to be
representative when no one else was willin’.”
Even if we’d tried to push the role on Keisei, he could have refused it.
As a matter of fact, Ishizaki had done so himself. He probably realized the
good faith gesture Keisei had made by accepting the role now.
“It pissed me off, gettin’ ordered around by you. But if you didn’t give
those orders, our group probably would’ve been way worse off. For makin’
breakfast, and for the marathon.”
“No doubts there,” said Hashimoto, laughing.
Some students do well in academics, and some don’t. Some excel in
sports, and some struggle. When all these different students, with their own
interests and backgrounds, come together to form a single class or group,
they bring their problems with them. All the friendships and rivalries and
everything of the sort.
Yahiko and the other students started chatting themselves, speaking up
little by little.
That was the first night we started to feel like a real group.

Chapter 7:
What Is Lost, What Isn’t
 
IT WAS EARLY in the morning on the seventh day. The last full day.
The final test would be held the next morning. Although Hashimoto’s quick
thinking had kept our group from collapsing, the alliances we’d slowly
developed as we came together would end with that test. There were probably
more than a few people here who felt a hint of reluctance to part ways.
At the end of the day, despite their dislike for Kouenji, I thought most
of the students in our group were getting along well. Well, Ishizaki probably
hated me even more than he did Kouenji, but he was doing his best not to let
that show. He probably wanted nothing more than to confront me but knew
exactly what would happen if he tried it.
Ishizaki was like Sudou, in that they were both quick to lose their
tempers and had a coarse way of speaking. However, Ishizaki was cannier
than Sudou. I also got the impression that he respected his opponents and
earnestly acknowledged their strengths. That was probably why Ryuuen had
kept him close.
That didn’t mean Sudou was inferior to Ishizaki. He was more athletic
by far, and at this point in time, probably doing better than Ishizaki
academically too. As long as Horikita was helping him, Sudou would
probably continue to improve. He and Ishizaki might be similar, but they had
different weapons at their disposal.
“I want to talk about the long-distance relay tomorrow. Please hear me
out.”
Everyone, still in their beds, looked over at Keisei.
“There’s only ten of us, so each person will be shouldering quite a bit
of responsibility. But depending on how things play out, we might be able to
turn this to our advantage.”
“What do you mean? Isn’t it better to have more people, so each of
them has to run a shorter distance? Wouldn’t that be easier?”
“It’s certainly true that if fifteen people had to split the burden equally,
177
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
each person would have less to do. But the larger the group, the higher the
probability that you’ll have slow students on your team. I can count the
number of people who are good at running long-distance marathons on my
fingers.”
“Yeah, you’ve got a point.”
“In other words, this is our chance to close the gap.”
“But that’s assumin’ our entire group’s athletic, right?”
Ishizaki looked around. I could be classified as athletic, but since we
couldn’t really count upon Kouenji, that meant the only other runner in the
group was Hashimoto. We didn’t exactly have a surplus of speedy people.
“This is going to sound pathetic, but…despite saying all that, I
probably won’t be of any use,” said Keisei.
He knew his limitations best. Of everyone in the group, Keisei had the
worst stamina and speed. But as the representative, he came up with a plan.
“The long-distance relay is eighteen kilometers. The rules state that
every person has to run a minimum of 1.2 kilometers. So in a group of
fifteen, everyone would have to run the same distance: 1.2 kilometers each.
However, in a group of ten people, you can make significant changes to how
you allocate the distances.”
“We can’t just say someone’s injured and can’t participate, can we?”
“Any absence on that day due to injury or illness will result in a
penalty. Not only will that cause more trouble for the remaining people, it
also costs us time. That’s no good. Plus, the changeover point has to be every
1.2 kilometers.”
The school was working hard to squash any loopholes. Students would
have to do what was required of them. So Keisei and Yahiko, who lacked
confidence in their speed, would have to run the minimum distance of 1.2
kilometers. The three guys from Class B might be placed at that bare
minimum too.
Albert was reasonably fast, but the problem was his stamina. Even if
everyone else in the group ran the bare minimum distance, the remaining four
people would each have to run an average of 2.7 kilometers, if not more…but
students who were skilled in long-distance marathon running might very well
178
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
be capable of that. Which meant the thoughts crossing my mind were exactly
what Keisei was getting at.
“In that case, I’ll run 3…nah, I’ll do 3.6 kilometers,” declared Ishizaki.
He was certainly one of the few members in our group who could handle it.
Another person raised his hand.
“In that case, it looks like I gotta do the same thing. I’m not too shabby
when it comes to running long distances myself,” said Hashimoto. Two of the
most qualified members of the group had earnestly promised to shoulder a
significant burden. That meant we’d covered 7.2 kilometers.
“Thank you.”
Keisei bowed in gratitude. If this was how things were going, I
supposed I needed to cover a certain amount myself.
“Then…I’ll try to do what I can. I don’t know how fast I can run it,
though,” I told Keisei.
“Is that okay, Kiyotaka?”
“Just don’t expect too much from me.”
However, the crucial part was what came next. The man known as
Kouenji—the person with the highest potential here, the person who topped
our class in stamina and athleticism, whom not even Sudou would hold a
candle to. The more Kouenji ran, the easier it would be for the other students.
He would probably run the minimum distance of 1.2 kilometers, but he had
yet to promise to do anything more than that.
More importantly, there was no telling if he would seriously run. Even
if the nine of us ran our hearts out, we’d be done for if Kouenji decided to
stroll along.
“Kouenji. I would like you to run too.” It was precisely because Keisei
was aware of being the weakest link himself that he bowed his head even
lower when addressing Kouenji.
Kouenji sat in bed, looking at his own fingernails and smiling.
“Kouenji.”
Keisei calmly called his name once more.
“I will run, of course. However, unlike those fellows, I am not so
179
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
inclined to run long distances,” said Kouenji.
Well, it wouldn’t have been like him to agree right off the bat. Ishizaki
glared at Kouenji but didn’t attempt to hound him. The last few days had
made him begin to understand Kouenji’s actions better, including their
apparent meaninglessness.
“I would like to avoid our group placing last.”
“I suppose so. I understand what you’re saying, Glasses-kun.”
Shifting his gaze away from his fingernails, Kouenji glanced at Keisei.
“Even if running long-distance is impossible, I will at least run 1.2
kilometers with serious effort.”
Everyone in the group looked at Kouenji.
“I cannot make any promises. Even if our group does place last, it’s not
as though I will be expelled. Only you, the representative, will be. You surely
wouldn’t do something so inhuman as drag a classmate to ruin with you. Isn’t
that right?”
If the representative had been someone like Ishizaki or Yahiko, then
perhaps Kouenji would have run. But since it was Keisei, a classmate, he
figured he was safe. If we threatened him with expulsion regardless, there
was a slight chance we might be able to get him to run here and now—but
only at the cost of never having his cooperation ever again.
“Then tell me. What do we have to do to get you to cooperate? If
paying you private points will help, I’ll do that,” said Keisei. Again, it was
precisely because he understood he was the greatest liability in that group
that he was willing to pay out of his own pocket.
“Don’t carry that burden alone, Yukimura,” Hashimoto said. “I don’t
have much, but I’ve got points.”
“I’ll pay too.”
Yahiko and the other guys joined in, agreeing to help out. I guess it
was like they said, every little bit counts. If the nine of us pooled our points,
we’d end up with a fairly large sum. How would Kouenji react to the unified
wishes of the entire group?
“Unfortunately for you, I’m not exactly struggling as far as private
180
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
points are concerned. Besides, I could lead a fulfilling life at school even if I
didn’t have any points, you see.”
As I’d anticipated, he wasn’t even slightly moved by our promise of
cash. Asking him to do his best for the group’s sake was clearly pointless,
too. Everyone in the group, myself included, had racked their brains for the
last few days, trying to figure out how to get Kouenji to cooperate. Our
seniors had tried too. And every attempt had ended in failure.
“Are you saying that you won’t run for us?”
“Yes, I suppose so,” said Kouenji after a moment’s thought. “It doesn’t
seem that I will be an asset to you all,” he added.
Ishizaki, who’d held himself back so far, stood up to go for Kouenji,
but Keisei stopped him.
“However, rest assured about one thing. While I don’t intend to do
anything more than what is required, I will do the bare minimum. I have my
own way of doing things, you see.”
“So that means…you’ll produce average results?”
“That is correct. Of course, even by doing the bare minimum, I will
still most likely produce superior results. I suppose this is good news for you
all, isn’t it?”
I had a feeling that everyone present understood what he meant when
he said that. We’d started to feel like a team at long last, even if it was just
barely so. We’d started thinking about what we could do for each other, as
friends.
My analysis of the situation told me that the reality, however, was that
Kouenji was acting from purely selfish motives. He’d behaved in completely
unprecedented ways in every exam we’d had so far, but none of those things
he did were enough to get him expelled. Kouenji had figured that there was a
99 percent chance that Keisei wouldn’t drag him down with him, but that still
left the possibility, no matter how slim, of it happening. If he did perform
poorly, the school would make note of it, and then he’d have no way of
escaping the solidarity rule if it was invoked against him. A guy like him
wouldn’t make that mistake.
“Whaddya mean, excellent results? You can’t even do something like
181
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
zazen right.”
“Heh. I mastered things like zazen in my early childhood. It’s no
problem.”
“What was your childhood like?” someone asked.
Kouenji just laughed, ignoring the question. Still, this might be good
enough for Keisei. Even though Kouenji had no intention of cooperating with
us, he promised to do the bare minimum. That alone was huge. As his
classmates, we knew the sheer extent of his potential.
There were still several unknowns, like zazen and the written test, but
we could at least place our faith in Kouenji’s physical fitness for the
marathon.

WITH ONE PROBLEM SOLVED, it was time for our morning dusting.
When Keisei was about to start cleaning, Ishizaki went over and picked up
the dustcloth.
“Take a break. If you can’t run in the relay, that’ll be worse.”
“Well, but—”
“Rest. In exchange, do your best on the written exam. Get at least 120
percent, will ya?”
“Okay. It’s impossible to get 120 percent, but I’ll shoot for 100…”
It seemed Ishizaki finally understood what it meant to give and take.
Keisei thanked him gratefully and sat down.
“Quite prudent of you, Delinquent-kun.”
“Shut your piehole or I’ll kill ya, Kouenji. You haven’t done a single
damn thing since the first damn day!”
“Is that so? Ha ha ha!”
Kouenji didn’t take a dustcloth or broom. Instead, he left, strolling
outside to be in nature. Even with the second- and third-years watching, he
acted brash.
“That dude is a disease. Can you guys even make it to the upper classes
with him along for the ride?”
Even the Class D folks felt sorry for us.
“…I can’t say I’m confident.”
Keisei had always felt strongly about climbing the ranks, but Kouenji
was a most bizarre variable. His performance tomorrow would have a huge
impact on our scores. He’d promised to do the bare minimum during our
morning discussion, but that guaranteed nothing. It was entirely possible he’d
skip out on his duties as soon as he was out of sight.
If he refused to even participate in something like cleaning, there was a
very real chance that we might come in last place. If that happened, even the
183
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
upperclassmen who’d turned a blind eye to him so far might suddenly bare
their fangs at him. While I generally thought of Kouenji as a calculating
person who wouldn’t do something so foolish, his complete and total
irrationality made me wary of the possibility that he might betray my
expectations.
Sensing Keisei’s anxiety, Ishizaki approached.
“Don’t worry. We just gotta compensate for him.”
“That sure doesn’t sound like you. You’ve become much more
understanding in only a day.”
“Shut it, Hashimoto. What, you got a problem?!”
“No problem. Our group’s ranking impacts my own plans. I’d like for
us to score at least one spot above the lowest rank. Isn’t that right, Yahiko?”
“Well, yeah. Since our group’s a handful, we have no choice but to do
our best. If we get a poor score, Katsuragi-san will be disappointed in us,”
said Yahiko.
Hashimoto had a wry smile on his face as he smacked Yahiko, who
was focused on Katsuragi as always, lightly on the shoulder. Yahiko had to
be aware he’d hold us back during activities like the marathon. He’d been
behaving pretty humbly since the test started.
“I’ve squared off against Katsuragi many times on Sakayanagi’s
orders. You probably resent me for that, but right now we’re allies for real.
Please forget about the past.”
“Hmm. Maybe.”
Yahiko didn’t shout or make a scene, but I got the sense his trust in
Hashimoto had its limits. Some part of him likely couldn’t forgive Hashimoto
for the way Katsuragi had been hindered by his own classmates so far.
“Didn’t you set up Katsuragi-san to be the representative?” asked
Yahiko.
“I had nothing to do with that. That was Matoba’s plan.”
Yahiko didn’t seem convinced. But he controlled himself, choosing not
to disrupt the group. I had to give him credit for that.

IT WAS OUR FINAL DINNER before the exam. I spotted Ichinose walking
past, carrying a tray, and called out to her. I wasn’t attempting to draw
information out of her. It was just that, well…something seemed a little off
about her.
“Is something bothering you?”
“Huh? Oh, Ayanokouji-kun. Nothing, really. I was just thinking about
this and that.”
“You’re facing a difficult problem, huh?”
Ichinose seemed about to walk away but then stopped. “The final test
is tomorrow. What do you think about this exam, Ayanokouji-kun?”
“That’s a really roundabout question.”
“I want you to tell me your honest thoughts.”
“I guess it seems different from the exams we’ve had until now. A little
tougher. There’s a high risk of expulsion.”
“I see. But we’re in our third semester now. Isn’t it only natural that
things would get more difficult?”
“I guess.”
“Speaking of risks, this whole representative system is scary, huh?
Becoming the leader of a group.”
“Yeah.”
“Being the representative is very risky, but…becoming the
representative for the sake of winning is also important, right?”
I didn’t argue, just listened intently to what she had to say.
“Even if you say there’s the risk of expulsion, I guess it’s kind of
like…that’s all up in the air somehow. Like it doesn’t really feel real. …To
be honest, there’s a great deal that’s still hidden from me. But what I’m really
scared of isn’t losing class points or private points.”
185
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“You’re talking about your classmates?”
“Yeah. The risk of losing one of them is unfathomable.”
“If a classmate were expelled, what would you intend to do?” I asked.
“What would I do?” Ichinose slowly looked up, a thin smile on her
face. “Ayanokouji-kun, you really are a smart guy, aren’t you?”
“Why do you say that?”
“I mean, normally, there’s nothing you can do if someone’s expelled,
right? But you know there’s always a way.”
“It was a hypothetical question.”
“If it were really a hypothetical, you wouldn’t have used the word
intend, would you? You’d say, ‘What would happen?’ or phrase it completely
differently, like, ‘Would your class be okay?’ or something.”
“Sorry. You’re giving me way too much credit. My language skills
aren’t that advanced.”
“Still. I think you have a very respectable sense of intuition.”
She then told me she’d gotten too caught up in chatting and that she’d
see me later. Ichinose walked off, probably burdened with plenty of things
she needed to ponder alone. I watched other students call out to her as she
went. Being popular was rough. Even when you just wanted some time to
think, people wouldn’t leave you alone.
Still, Ichinose always had a smile on her face. But that didn’t seem to
be the case today.
“Yeah. Sorry, I’m just not feeling up to it today,” said Ichinose,
walking away from two girls whom she was close to. She sounded dispirited.
“Sorry. I just have some things going on. I feel like I’d like to be alone for
today.”
This was no act. She seemed like a completely different person from
when our first day at this camp.
Seeing that, I understood. Sakayanagi had made her move. The coming
storm wasn’t just going to hit the guys. The girls might just be in for it, too.

SINCE IT WAS THE FINAL DAY before the exam, things had changed
dramatically. The mood in the cafeteria remained unchanged, but you could
clearly tell who was laughing and who was depressed. In short, there was a
clear distinction between those whose groups were doing well and those
whose groups were not.
As I stepped out into the hallway, Kei was there, leaning against the
wall near the entrance to the cafeteria.
She casually slipped me a piece of paper as I passed by, then
immediately entered the cafeteria, probably going to meet up with her
friends. As we parted ways, I looked at the slip of paper, then shredded it and
divided the pieces up between several trash bins placed all around the
building.
She’d held on pretty well throughout the week, but it seemed she was
finally at her limit.
I walked to a corner of the school building, where the person whom
Kei had been keeping an eye on for me was trying to grab some alone time.
Solitude was a limited resource at this camp. There was the middle of the
night, sure, but others would notice if you were gone from your shared room
for a long period of time. Your best option was to make use of the time when
everyone was gathered in the cafeteria.
As I followed the person in question, she crouched down, like she was
trying to hide. She didn’t notice me there. I watched her trying to hold back
tears, and I hesitated, wondering what to do.
But no matter how hard it might be for someone to find this place,
there was no telling when another student might just show up. I should wrap
this up fast.
“If you’re in some kind of trouble…maybe you should talk to the
former student council president?”
“Huh?!”
187
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Third-year Class A student Tachibana Akane looked up at me.
Panicked at being seen in such a pathetic state, she quickly wiped her tears
away.
188
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
189
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Wh-what is it?”
“Nothing. Just exactly what I said.”
“I’m not in any trouble or anything.”
“If you’re crying even though you’re not in trouble, that might be a
problem in and of itself.”
“I’m not crying!”
As she said that, Tachibana averted her eyes from me. She probably
wasn’t moving from the spot she was in because she knew her reddened eyes
and the wetness on her face would be clearly visible if she went somewhere
brightly lit.
“Sometimes I just want to be alone.”
“True. We don’t get much private time, huh?”
Bathroom breaks were it, more or less, and you could only use those
for so long. There were always students coming and going, seeing you there.
“For the record, I’m on Former President Horikita’s side.”
That was a lie. But if I said that, Tachibana would trust me more.
“Doesn’t matter. You’re not going to be any help.”
Well…when she put it like that, I had no response. In fact, I might
accidentally give away something I didn’t want to if I kept going.
“Just consider the fact that it’s better if we’re not enemies.”
“Okay, can you stop talking to your seniors in such a casual way? I
haven’t said anything about it to you until now because Horikita-kun was
there, but…”
Rather than the rebuke, what piqued my curiosity was the fact that she
called him “Horikita-kun.” She usually continued to refer to him as President
Horikita, which was odd in its own right, given he was no longer in office.
She could tack on the word former before that title, but the way Tachibana
referred to him was strange.
“You… It must be nice being a first-year. So carefree.”
“Wow, you sound pretty scared. Are you anxious about the test
190
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
tomorrow?”
“I don’t feel anything. The representative’s at stake and all, but things
aren’t bad between people in our group or anything. If anything, things are
going great.”
“In that case, why are you crying?”
“I-I told you, I wasn’t crying!”
When I pointed at Tachibana’s eyes, she panicked and touched her face
to check for any fresh tears that might have welled up. When she realized I’d
fooled her, she glared at me.
“Horikita-kun…is the one that I’m worried about,” she said.
That was a lie…and at the same time not. But I wouldn’t touch that just
yet.
“Worry, huh? Is there really anything to worry about when it comes to
that guy?”
“Horikita-kun… Horikita-kun has been fighting alone for a long time.
He’s been fighting the second- and third-years all this time. You can’t
possibly understand how difficult it is to have to face everyone all by
yourself.”
True. I’d never understand that, even if I tried.
“I know a little bit about how the second-years, particularly Nagumo,
are his enemies,” I said. “But he has enemies among the third-years too? Not
many people would want to rebel against the former student council
president, right?”
“Do you take Horikita-kun for some kind of dictator? Even when he
was student council president, he never did just as he pleased, like Nagumo-
kun. You can never afford to let your guard down in any test.”
I had never gotten the opportunity to learn about the third-years’
internal affairs. I didn’t know a single thing about the elder Horikita’s
background. But if she said they couldn’t afford to let their guard down in
any exam, that meant…
“Wait. You mean the class conflict among the third-years is still
ongoing?”
191
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“If Horikita-kun fails, then Class A will definitely fall.”
“Huh.”
Nagumo had said the same thing. He’d mentioned the gap between
third-year Classes A and B was only 312 points. If Horikita’s brother was the
main weapon at Class A’s disposal, or if Class B had a remarkably skilled
student up their sleeve, it was certainly possible their lead might be
overturned.
“So even he’s just a normal student.”
“Horikita-kun is…! Nothing. Forget it.”
She raised her voice unintentionally but then quieted herself.
Tachibana began to speak, slower this time, as though letting her frustration
spill forth.
“It’s because the rest of us in Class A are always holding the class
back. We lost a ton of class points that we shouldn’t have, and even private
points, too… He’s always sacrificing himself to protect his comrades.”
If what Tachibana was saying was true, then Horikita’s brother was
much like Hirata—which surprised me, to be honest. Of course, if Tachibana,
who was actually in the third-year Class A, said it…there had to be some
degree of truth to it. If I had to guess, there had probably been a lot of
occasions when the elder Horikita handled things behind the scenes, so no
one saw what a virtuous person he was. And the person who’d seen him do
those things, by his side more often than anyone else, was this girl here.
“So you’re depressed by the current situation?”
“Even I’ve heard about what’s going on with the boys. Including the
fact that Nagumo-kun challenged Horikita-kun to a contest, and because of
that, he can’t make a move. We can’t help him at all.”
“That depends on how tenacious you are, doesn’t it?”
“I know that.”
Fresh tears may have welled up in her eyes, because Tachibana wiped
them with her arm once more. Her concern for Horikita’s brother may have
been one reason for her tears, but I was betting there was more to it.
“You’re in some kind of trouble, aren’t you?”
192
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“I’m not. Not really.”
“Not really?”
“You’re persistent, aren’t you? I’m not in any kind of trouble.”
“If you say so, I must be mistaken.”
“You are. Please don’t say anything weird to Horikita-kun.”
“Okay.”
With that stern warning, Tachibana headed back to the cafeteria. She
probably didn’t want Horikita’s brother to learn the truth of whatever was
going on with her. But she’d made an error in judgment. This wasn’t a
problem you could solve by sacrificing yourself.
“I suppose this means it’s checkmate if I don’t make a move, huh?”
Watching Tachibana’s frail, slender back as she walked off, I was sure
of that fact.

IT WAS MIDNIGHT when I was woken up by a slight creaking sound. A
lone student was moving in the pitch darkness. Of course, despite the lack of
visibility, I still knew who it was—Hashimoto, who was supposed to be
sleeping in the bunk above me right now. He descended from the top bunk
without making a sound and left the room without even bringing a flashlight
with him. When he was gone, I slowly sat up.
It was most likely a bathroom break, but there were other possibilities
too. What caught my attention was the fact that, over the course of the last
week, Hashimoto hadn’t once slipped out of the room in the middle of the
night to go to the bathroom.
After giving him a slight head start, I got up and followed. On the off
chance that he happened to be standing outside the door, I’d just say I’d
gotten up to use the bathroom too. We shared the same bunk bed; Hashimoto
would just think he’d woken me up.
I stealthily went into the corridor. Even though the only illumination
came from the emergency lighting and a sliver of moonlight, I could walk
without a flashlight. Hashimoto headed toward the bathroom, then
disappeared from view. I started following him. I quickly saw him turn left,
even though the bathroom was straight down the hall.
So he didn’t need the bathroom, apparently. Hashimoto descended to
the first floor and went outside, still wearing his indoor slippers. I hid myself,
hugging the wall. There were no other students around. Maybe he simply
came outside to get some fresh air because he couldn’t sleep. Or perhaps he
was waiting for someone?
I learned the answer to my question right away.
Sensing that he was going to turn my way, I moved to a different spot
when I saw another shadow, which I assumed was his target. The shadow
moved along the same path as Hashimoto and went outside. It was so quiet
you couldn’t even hear insects, which meant even a whisper sounded clear as
a bell.

“Hey, Ryuuen,” Hashimoto said.
“The hell do you want with me?”
“I just wanted to chat. I mean, you stand out way too much in the
cafeteria, dude. The only time I can talk to you is the middle of the night.”
“On the last day?”
“Yeah. I called you here because it’s the last day. Right now, everyone
else is sound asleep.”
“I see. Guess you got a point.”
No students would deliberately stay up late into the night when there
was an exam the next day. Still, Ryuuen and Hashimoto…that was a pairing I
wouldn’t have expected. Then again, Ryuuen had formed a relationship with
Class A back during our time on the uninhabited island. I wouldn’t be
surprised if Hashimoto had played the part of intermediary.
“Look, I’m not good at talking about stuff in a roundabout way. So I
want to hear a straight answer. Did you really quit being the class leader?”
“Hee hee hee. Doesn’t seem like you believe it, huh?”
“At the very least, I don’t buy that Ishizaki and the others worked you
over,” replied Hashimoto, zeroing in on the detail that stuck out to him. True,
the idea of Ishizaki beating Ryuuen was pretty dumb.
“Ishizaki aside, Albert’s trouble. If we really went head-to-head with
one another, it’d be brutal.”
“I see. Well, Albert’s certainly a threat, I guess. But the Ryuuen
Kakeru I know isn’t the kind of guy to cower before an opponent. If
anything, he’s the sort of guy who’s always thinking up counterattacks, isn’t
he?”
Rather than diminish Hashimoto’s suspicions, what Ryuuen had said
only heightened them.
“I just got tired of trying to unite people who keep rebelling against
me. As long as I continue to bleed you Class A folks dry, I’m in the clear. I
ain’t got any obligation to those other guys.”
“I see. So that’s it.”
“Did I convince you?”
195
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Not sure. I’m still fifty-fifty. Personally, I think I want you to fight
back against the situation you’re in.”
“So you can score some more pocket change?”
“Yep. I want the ‘promise of Class A.’ Just like you.”
If you could save up twenty million points, then you could buy the
right to move into A Class. A student with the means to do that could rest
easy—an enviable situation. Making that goal a reality was difficult, but it
seemed Hashimoto was one of the students aiming to do just that.
“If the promise of victory is what you crave, I’m guessing you’re
prepared to dispose of Sakayanagi?”
“If necessary.”
Hashimoto continued.
“Selling out Sakayanagi doesn’t come cheap, Ryuuen. Right now,
she’s at the top of our class. I’m on the winning team. Get it?”
“We’ll see how much of an opportunist you really are.”
“I’m pretty good at making my way in the world. You should know
that I can come out on top pretty well. Anyway, I’m glad I could talk with
you directly. Doesn’t look like you’ve lost your fire.”
Hashimoto yawned, then added one last thing.
196

“When you got overtaken by Hirata’s class, I wondered what the hell
you were even doing. But they might be a tough bunch after all.”
“Huh?”
“If you examine each member with a level head, you can see they’re
pretty evenly matched. I’d like for them to be crushed as soon as possible.”
“Huh. To think a guy like you would be sizing them up. Any particular
guy caught your interest?”
“Kouenji is a threat, at the very least. To be honest, if he started acting
to his class’s advantage, there’s no telling what would happen to Class A.
They also have academically gifted students like Hirata and Yukimura, and
Sudou, who’s easily one of the most athletic students in our grade.”
“I don’t know about those other guys, but I can’t imagine Sudou will
do anything terribly special.”
Hashimoto chuckled in agreement.
“Anyway, there’s no telling what will happen, but here’s something to
keep in mind. Even if Hirata’s group does manage to make it all the way to
Class A, I’m fine as long as there’s room for me to slip in there too.”
“I doubt you have that much power. Try not to get burned,” said
Ryuuen mockingly, as if to end the conversation there.
“It’s shitty, but dragging this out is just a hassle.”
“Yeah.”
I thought they’d wrap up there, so I prepared to move. Hashimoto
would probably head back to the room. If I wasn’t asleep before he got back,
he might suspect something.
But I sensed someone else approaching and stopped in my tracks. One
of the two people who drew near immediately noticed Ryuuen and
Hashimoto and called out to them.
“What’s up, first-years? Having a secret meeting at a time like this,
huh?”
“Huh?”
Nagumo Miyabi and Horikita Manabu stood before the two
198
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
conspirators. Ryuuen paused for a moment, then immediately seemed to lose
interest and made to leave. He walked right toward Nagumo, who didn’t
budge.
“Outta the way.”
Nagumo laughed, like he found Ryuuen’s glare amusing. Meanwhile
Hashimoto, who had come back into the corridor to see what was going on,
locked eyes with Nagumo.
“I’ve heard you’re quite the delinquent. Your name’s Ryuuen, right?
I’m going to have a little chat with Horikita-senpai, but you should come
along.” Nagumo beckoned Hashimoto, summoning him to join them too.
“Ain’t interested,” said Ryuuen, shoulder-checking Nagumo as he
passed.
“Wow, you’re confident. Not scared of me, Ryuuen?”
“Doesn’t matter if you’re student council president or whatever. I’ll
crush anyone who gets in my way.”
“Heh.”
Nagumo seemed to have a certain degree of interest in Ryuuen, who
wasn’t bothered a bit.
“I don’t dislike people like you. But you’re not really fit to be part of
my student council.”
As Ryuuen tried to walk away, Nagumo called out to him once again.
“Hey, how about you join this wager, as a third party? Which group do
you think will place higher in today’s special exam, mine, or Horikita-
senpai’s? How about ten thousand points a head? No matter which side you
bet on, I’ll pay up if you’re right on the money. If you’re wrong, though, you
gotta pay up.”
“That’s dumb. Not interested in that kind of money.”
“Ten thousand is ‘that kind of money’, huh? You’re in Class D,
meaning you’re always short on cash, right? Can’t hurt to earn a little more.”
“In that case, make it a million. I’ll play along if you’re willing to pay
up,” said Ryuuen, turning around.
“Hahaha! You’re a funny guy, Ryuuen. Talk about a ballsy joke. You
199
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
can go now.”
Apparently, he thought Ryuuen’s proposal was a joke.
“If you don’t got the guts to pay up that much, don’t bother asking me
to make a bet.”
“Hey, you. First-year. You think Ryuuen can pay that much?” Nagumo
asked Hashimoto.
Since Hashimoto was aware of Ryuuen’s secret arrangement with
Class A, he knew Ryuuen definitely had enough. But…
“Not sure. We’re in different classes, so I can’t really say.”
“If we had our phones, we could check. I wouldn’t mind playing along
then. Too bad.”
Looked like the wager wasn’t going to happen then. Hashimoto moved
to make his escape, and Nagumo shifted his gaze over to Horikita.
“Horikita-senpai. Please abstain from taking the exam tomorrow,”
Nagumo said abruptly. Ryuuen continued walking, seemingly uninterested,
but Hashimoto stopped in his tracks.
“Abstain?”
“That’s right.”
“That’s an even worse joke than Ryuuen’s.”
“Actually, I’m being quite serious.” Nagumo added something else.
“It’s for your own sake, senpai.”
“Please explain it to me in a way I can understand. You have a habit of
just saying everything in your head, and it seems like you have yet to address
that.”
“Sorry. Being able to see too far into the future is a curse. Anyway, if
you don’t kindly abstain tomorrow, senpai, you’ll regret it. What I’m saying
is that I’m trying to help you. I could just put the hurt on you without
warning, but that would just be heartless, wouldn’t it?”
“What are you planning? Depending on what it is, I may not accept.”
“I understand. The rules of our contest are that we have to fight fair
and square, without involving any third parties. But the way things are, if the
200
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
exam takes place, we won’t know which of us will win until we get a look at
the results. Of course, it’s only to be expected that this will be a close race.
But that’s exactly why I want to win. And I’ve been taking steps to ensure I
do.”
“Is that why you want me to abstain?”
“Yes. Because abstaining will allow you to get through this with the
least amount of damage, senpai. Are you aware of the strategic groundwork
that I’ve laid? No, you aren’t, are you? There isn’t a single student at this
school who can read my thoughts. That’s what this is. Even your little
favorite is the same… Who was that first-year again?”
Nagumo looked intentionally at Hashimoto. But there was no way
Hashimoto knew.
“Ah, that’s right. If I recall, he’s in the same group as that first-year.
Ayanokouji Kiyotaka.” Nagumo clearly emphasized my name, as though he
were trying to make Hashimoto aware of it. “What do you think, Hashimoto?
About Ayanokouji.”
“What do I…? Well, I think he’s just a normal student.”
Hashimoto was visibly shaken after unexpectedly hearing my name
come up.
“I know, right? But Horikita-senpai here seems to value Ayanokouji
over all other first-years.”
“Maybe because he performed well at the relay during the Sports
Festival?”
“Well, that would make sense. But that doesn’t seem to be all there is
to it. See, Horikita-senpai prizes Ayanokouji above even Sakayanagi, even
Ryuuen, even Ichinose. Since you’re in the same group as him, I thought you
might have noticed something.”
“No.”
“Why is that, senpai? Please, I think it’s about time you tell me the
reason.”
“You’re reaching, Nagumo. When have I spoken highly of
Ayanokouji? There is nothing to be gained by spreading lies. Stop teasing the
first-years.”
201
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Sorry, senpai. I suppose you’re right. My bad, Hashimoto. That was a
little joke.”
“Is that so…?”
I didn’t like where this conversation was headed, but it was time I got
out of there. The three of them were blocking the corridor, so I needed to use
the stairs on the opposite end of the building. It meant taking a detour, but I
decided to go the alternate route. I had to be back by the time Hashimoto
returned, or it might end up making him suspect there was something to what
Nagumo was saying.
A few minutes after I returned, Hashimoto quietly entered the room. I
felt his gaze fall upon me from the top bunk, but only for a moment.
Afterward, he went to sleep.

Chapter 8:
The Second Half of the Girls’ Battle:
Horikita Suzune
 
THE FINAL TEST would be the next day. The rest of the student body
was busy gobbling down their dinner when I, Horikita Suzune, made contact
with a certain someone inside our room. With everyone else in the cafeteria at
the time, it was simple for the two of us to make contact.
“Look, Horikita-san. To be honest with you, I don’t think you’re seeing
the current situation for what it is.”
Standing before me was Kushida-san, a serious look in her eyes. In the
cramped confines of the camp school, with eyes and ears everywhere, I
couldn’t neglect to keep tabs on her—even though it was her public-facing
persona that stood before me now.
“I’m not seeing the current situation? What do you mean by that?”
“You forced me to be in the same group as you, for the purpose of
keeping me under surveillance…or to have me acknowledge you as a
comrade. Is that right?”
She spoke in her normal, friendly tone of voice, clearly operating on
the assumption that someone might enter the room at any moment. But there
was something more forceful than usual to the way she said it, almost
certainly because she felt secure that I couldn’t pull any tricks like recording
our conversation with my smartphone in our current situation. Personally, I
welcomed her honesty. If she always kept her true nature hidden, we’d never
move forward.
“I won’t deny that those objectives are part of it,” I said.
I made sure to emphasize part quite strongly, but Kushida-san ignored
it.
“You seem to be acting on your personal feelings. I wonder how that
will work as a strategy. It’s certainly true that you and I don’t get along,
Horikita-san. But if you were thinking about the group’s scores…no, if you
203
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
were thinking about your class, shouldn’t you keep your personal feelings out
of it?” said Kushida-san, crossing her arms with a sigh, as if thrusting her
honest opinion at me. “You’ve made me, and me alone, your priority.
Winning and losing are just secondary concerns. Am I wrong?”
“I can’t deny that either.”
“So you admit it.”
Frankly, there was no way I could deny it. Ever since the Paper
Shuffle, I’d considered Kushida-san my primary concern. I even invited her
out for tea during winter vacation. I was doing things I’d never done before.
“It doesn’t matter what you do,” she said. “Enough already. I want you
to understand that.”
“Unfortunately, I’m afraid I can’t let this go.”
So long as my problems with Kushida-san went unresolved, I couldn’t
move forward.
“Look, it’s not my place to say this, but have you forgotten about how
you dragged me out in front of the student council president and made me
swear I wouldn’t do anything? Putting aside my own feelings, which I will
not get over, I promised I wouldn’t do anything to sabotage you, Horikita-
san. I thought you’d at least trust me that much. Or did you think I’d break
my promise right away?”
I couldn’t answer her question with words. Kushida-san probably
understood my feelings. What she said was half correct; even though I
expected she’d keep her promise, however reluctantly, I also thought she
might be working behind the scenes to get me expelled. Those two instincts
clashed within me.
If I truly trusted Kushida-san, I wouldn’t feel the need to stick by her
all hours of the day. Moreover, while my brother isn’t the sort who would say
anything to anyone else, once he graduated, the oath she swore would be
meaningless. If I were to take action, it would have to be soon. Time was of
the essence.
“I want you to trust me,” I told her, deciding to get straight to the point.
“Wow, you’re blunt.”
Despite apparently taking what I said at face value, Kushida-san wore a
204
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
thin smile on her face. But it wasn’t a smile of agreement. I couldn’t let
myself be mistaken on that count.
“No matter what, I will not say anything to anyone about your past.
What do I have to do to make you believe me?”
“Unfortunately, there’s no way you can convince me,” replied
Kushida-san flatly.
“I gain nothing by telling people.”
“You’re certainly right about that. If I did find out you told someone,
I’d show no mercy. I might even destroy the entire class, just like I did back
in junior high. As someone who’s aiming for Class A, you obviously
wouldn’t put yourself in jeopardy. At least, that’s what you’d assume,” said
Kushida-san.
She seemed to understand. So what was the problem?
“But if you ask me, our current environment’s a little cramped.”
“Cramped?”
“For example, would you obey a stranger who puts a knife to the back
of your neck and says he’ll hurt you if you don’t cooperate? There’s a
difference between a situation where you can’t be hurt even if someone tried
to and a situation where someone could hurt you if they wanted to. You
understand, don’t you?”
Kushida-san didn’t trust anyone. She didn’t make her decisions based
on whether they advantaged or disadvantaged her; she simply couldn’t stand
anyone else holding power over her. That’s why she wanted to eliminate me.
The problem was I couldn’t let go of the knife, even if I wanted to.
“Aren’t you just strangling yourself with your own two hands then?” I
said. “As a matter of fact, the number of people who know about you are
slowly but surely increasing.”
“That’s right. I will admit that the situation has gotten more dire.”
“You’re clever. You’re above average in both academics and athletics,
and you have the best communication skills in our grade level… No,
depending on how you look at it, you might even be able to say you’re the
best in the school. Even talking to you now, I’m impressed by your quick
thinking. You could be an incredible asset to our class if you simply
205
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
cooperated with us. You’d be even more beloved by your peers too.”
“Do you honestly not get that your know-it-all tone irritates me more
than anything else? You’re talking this way because you know my true
personality. I can’t stand that. If you didn’t know anything about me, you
wouldn’t be saying these things.”
“That’s…”
She would never accept anyone knowing about her past. Her resolve
was clear.
“You’re smarter than me. Wouldn’t you do just fine even at another
school? Besides, you came here so you could be at the same school as your
older brother. Right, Horikita-san? But your brother will be graduating soon,
so you won’t need to force yourself to stay. You could study at a different
school, go on to college or land a job. Wouldn’t that be fine?” asked
Kushida-san.
She was trying to cut our conversation short, as though saying that
trying to talk to her any longer would just be a waste of time. I let out a quiet
sigh.
“I’ll be quiet for now. But I will never trust or cooperate with you,
Horikita-san. Until either you or I are gone from this school, we’ll never be
okay. No matter how many times we have this conversation. You’d do well
to remember that.”
“I understand. I’ll leave things for today.”
“Not just today. This is the last time.”
Kushida-san walked out of the room, leaving me with those parting
words.
“I really am powerless, aren’t I?”
I had very few comrades I could trust. Ayanokouji-kun seemed like the
one I could most often rely on, but he and I had grown more distant of late,
probably because I forced him to talk about the student council in front of
Kushida-san. But I couldn’t back down. I had to keep her close to protect
myself.
Even if it cost me his cooperation, I would choose Kushida-san. No—I
must choose her.

Chapter 9:
Blind Spot
 
IT WAS THE FINAL DAY of camp, the day when our groups would be
ranked according to the special exam. During this last week, the twenty-six or
so small groups had passed time in their own unique ways. Some groups had
gotten to know one another better and worked well together. Others were on
the verge of collapse. Others had completed their daily tasks with
indifference, growing neither closer nor further apart.
At first, our group had been a disaster. However, we’d grown
significantly closer to one another by the end. I mean, we weren’t perfect. At
best, we were a ragtag lot. This was a temporary alliance—come tomorrow,
we’d be enemies again. There was a certain sense of sadness at the thought of
our group activities coming to an end.
“For the time being, we’ve done all we can. No matter what the
outcome, we have no regrets.”
“I think so too. Thanks for being our representative, Yukimura.”
Ishizaki and Yukimura shook hands.
“No matter what happens, let’s give it our all.”
“Let’s do it.”
The other guys complimented each other and shook on it. Afterward,
we headed to our assigned classroom. There was nothing to worry about as
far as group unity. Our biggest concern was Kouenji.
Right now, he seemed calm, quietly following us. But no one could
predict when he might suddenly cut loose. The second- and third-years from
our large group had already arrived, so we hurried to our seats in a bit of a
panic just as the chime sounded. The teacher entered and began to explain the
contents of the exam.
Even though we’d gathered in our large group, the exam would be
administered to the small groups by grade level. The large groups would
affect the overall ranking when the scores were tallied. No matter how vast
207
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
the camp grounds, if everyone tried doing all the same activities at the same
time, we’d be crammed in together.
The four sections of the exam were as expected. They included Zen,
Speech, Long-Distance Relay Race, and Written Exam. We first-year students
would begin with zazen. Then we headed to the next classroom for our
written exam. We’d follow that up with the long-distance relay race and,
finally, we’d give our speeches.
The second-years had a higher hurdle to jump right out of the gate,
since they were starting with the long-distance relay. The third-years,
apparently, were beginning with speeches.
208
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
9.1
 
AFTER WE FINISHED BREAKFAST, we headed to the zazen dojo. We were
exempted from cleaning this morning. The exam began as soon as all of the
first-year guys had gathered.
“Without further ado, we will begin. There are two criteria in
determining your scores: your manners and posture upon entering this dojo,
and the presence or absence of any disorder during zazen. After you’ve
finished, you will stand by in your assigned classrooms until you are given
instructions for your next exam. Starting now, I will call out names. Students
whose names have been called will line up and begin taking the test. Class A,
Katsuragi Kouhei. Class D, Ishizaki Daichi—”
The instructor continued to read names aloud. After Katsuragi came
Ishizaki. That was an unexpected development. The crowd murmured its
surprise.
“Hurry up, Ishizaki. Next, first-year Class B, Beppu Ryouta.”
Confused, Ishizaki got in line, panicking slightly.
“Is this a different order then usual?”
Keisei mentally prepared while panicking himself. We hadn’t expected
this. We’d performed zazen several times over the past week, but always in
our small groups. This time around, the school was assigning spots randomly.
That meant students outside our comfort zone would be close to our
personal bubble. That might seem like a trivial difference, but on the day of
the exam, when people were tense to begin with, it made everything that
much harder. The school’s goal to shake things up was working.
Keisei was flustered. Then a large hand rested on his shoulder—Albert,
offering a gesture of consideration to calm him down. Getting the message,
Keisei looked like he had regained a little bit of his composure.
“Sorry. If I’m like this during the very first exam, it’ll affect our
group’s morale.”
Rather than consider the pressure of being the representative as a
209
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
negative, Keisei thought of it as a positive. When his name was finally called,
he responded clearly and entered the dojo. I was called before Albert, the
second to last. Several instructors inside the dojo stood around holding
clipboards and pens.
On top of that, there was a strange number of cameras installed
throughout the dojo, perhaps to add certainty to the scoring. I already had the
basics of zazen down in my head, so I wasn’t going to slip up. Since it was
very likely the scoring system was set up in such a way where you’d start
with one hundred and have points deducted based on performance, I
calculated that I would definitely have a perfect score.
After all, there wasn’t any need for me to hold back in performing
zazen. A slight distance away from me, Kouenji was participating too. He
made no mistakes—in fact, he had beautiful posture. His movements were
flawless. He’d never once seemed to take practice seriously, but I guess this
was what you’d expect from him, huh?
Since we kept our eyes closed during the assessment, I couldn’t be sure
about the finer details. But I was sure we’d done well.
210
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
9.2
 
AFTER WE FINISHED with zazen, everyone began to disperse in silence.
We were still being graded until we actually left the dojo. Under the watchful
gaze of the instructors, the students silently exited and headed toward their
respective classrooms as instructed.
Once everyone in our group gathered, Keisei slumped in his chair.
“Ugh, my legs went numb during the test.”
“Did you make it?” asked Ishizaki. His legs might have suffered a
similar fate, because he rubbed at them as he asked Keisei that question.
“I think so. But I might’ve gotten a few points taken off.”
“Well, no use worryin’ about it. Nothing ya can do now. Right,
Ayanokouji?” said Hashimoto.
“That’s right. Next up is Keisei’s forte: the written exam. Just focus on
that,” I told him.
Nagumo’s words from last night were probably still in Hashimoto’s
head. But he wasn’t going to confront me directly about them, because he had
no idea what Horikita’s brother considered special about me in the first place.
Two other small groups of first-years were in the room with us. One of
them was the group that Ryuuen was in, which Akito was the representative
for. I could tell that Ishizaki and Albert shifted their gazes over toward
Ryuuen, but Ryuuen, rather than look back at us, took his seat, alone. He
didn’t talk to anyone. He was part of the group, but at the same time, he
wasn’t. He gave off an air of being completely and utterly isolated.
“Huh, that’s pretty weird,” muttered Hashimoto, standing next to me. It
would be easy for me to ignore him, but I supposed I’d play along a bit.
“What is?”
“Ishizaki and Albert’s eyes. I don’t get the impression that they hate
him. If anything, they look sorrowful. Like pets whose master has abandoned
them.”
211
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“I don’t get it. Didn’t Ishizaki and Albert get fed up with Ryuuen?”
“That’s what they say, but…maybe there’s something more to Ryuuen
stepping down. Don’t you think so?”
Hashimoto almost certainly had no evidence linking me to Ryuuen. It
was likely he was trying to steer the conversation in that direction because
Nagumo had expressed an interest in Ryuuen.
“Dunno. I’m not really familiar with other classes’ goings-on.”
“I see. Sorry for asking you something weird.”
After the ten-minute break ended, we moved on to the written exam,
which proved to be nothing special. They tested what we had learned during
our time at the camp. If you had a good grasp of the main topics we’d
covered, you could almost certainly get a perfect score. If you were a student
who struggled, you would get somewhere between fifty and seventy points.
What should I do?
While everyone else around me put their heads down and worked
away, I tried to figure out how many points I should allow myself to lose.
They probably weren’t going to make individual scores public, but I didn’t
want to let the school see me get successive perfect scores. There were a lot
of students who had been trying to feel me out as of late. Honestly, I would
much rather hold back and not score too high.
I decided I would miss just one question that people would consider
difficult. That would give me a solid 95 or so. After I finished penning down
all my answers, I was tempted to look out the window. I didn’t want the
teachers to think I was cheating, though, so I shut my eyes and waited for the
end.
After the test, the groups assembled and assessed our scores. It wasn’t
like calculating our scores ourselves was going to change the results, and yet,
I couldn’t really help but wonder whether I got that one question right or
wrong. I guessed forcing yourself to think differently was effective, to a
certain degree.
Everyone in our group was here except for Kouenji, who’d left the
classroom as soon as the test was over. Ishizaki, as expected, hadn’t
understood most of the questions. My insurance was going to come in handy.
212
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Still, the written exam had been easy overall, meaning every group probably
scored high.
Based on what I’d seen in the dojo, the written exam and zazen test
might not have resulted in a significant point gap between groups. Everyone
seemed to have performed zazen with a certain degree of precision. Both tests
were about demonstrating what you’d learned, so if you could pull that off,
there likely wouldn’t be a huge variation in scores. Of all the sections of the
exam, it was the long-distance relay race that was likely to have the biggest
impact.
If final scores were awarded based on where you placed in the relay,
you might assume that the group who got first place would have earned a
perfect score…but that was probably too simple, huh? I had a feeling they’d
be taking our times into consideration too. In fact, you might even score well
if you came in sixth place but made good time in the race.
When we left the classroom, I saw a number of vans parked outside. It
seemed they’d be taking us to the spot where the batons would be handed out.
When we got into the van, we received additional instructions from the
teachers.
Every individual student must run a minimum distance of 1.2
kilometers.
Baton passes are only allowed every 1.2 kilometers.
If a student is unable to finish the race due to an accident, or if they fail
to meet the minimum requirements, they will be disqualified.
After the teachers explained those three points, they dropped off
Keisei, our first runner, and the van drove on. We’d decided our running
order by the students who weren’t confident in their speed. Keisei was first.
Next were Sumida, Tokitou, and Moriyama from Class B. Yahiko was fifth.
We placed them like that because there were relative dips and rises in
the terrain during the early stages of the race. Also, it put as little pressure as
possible on them to worry about being overtaken by other runners. Those five
would run the minimum distance each. Thus, we’d knock out a total of six
kilometers.
Next up would be Hashimoto. He’d run at full speed for 3.6 kilometers,
including the turnaround point. Then Albert would take the baton and run for
213
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
1.2 kilometers before passing it to Ishizaki, who’d run 3.6 kilometers.
I would’ve been fine with placing after Albert, but Keisei believed the
transition would be smoother if classmates were placed together.
Kouenji would only be running 1.2 kilometers. I was going to run 2.4
and pass the baton to him for the last leg. That was the conclusion that Keisei
had reached in the end. Kouenji was put last to give him a little more
motivation to finish. He’d get the credit for crossing the finish line, and
relieve some of our anxieties about him not passing on the baton.
The downside was that if anyone cut corners, we wouldn’t know who
was running late. After Ishizaki got out of the van, there were three of us left:
the instructor who was driving, Kouenji, and me. They could have dropped us
off first, since they were going around the turning point anyway, but I
supposed they intended to drop us off in the order we were running.
All that remained for me to do was wait at my spot 3.6 kilometers
away from the finish line.
The van started moving back in the direction we came from.
“Ayanokouji Boy. Allow me to ask you something plainly. Should we
take first place in this race, what do you think will happen? Overall, I mean.”
“…There’s no way that I’d know the answer to that, even if you ask.
Besides, our overall results are determined by the average score of the large
group. So it depends on how well the upperclassmen perform, right?”
No matter how hard we try, it’d be difficult to reach first place if they
dropped the ball.
“So you won’t even lie to reassure me that there’s a possibility of
getting first place, hmm?” he asked.
“You’re not the kind of guy who’d be cheered up if I said something
like that, are you?”
“Hmm, I have to wonder. How about you allow me to relieve you of
1.2 kilometers? If I run at full speed, there’s an extremely high chance we’ll
defeat the other groups,” Kouenji whispered into my ear, leaning in close.
“Okay, what the hell brought this about?” I asked.
“Just a whim. A whim that can help you. Not a bad offer, no?”
214
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“You mean to tell me that you’ll take responsibility for running 2.4
kilometers and for making us place well?”
“My, there’s no need to speak so formally. It’s just a whim, after all.”
“I see. Sorry, I’m turning you down. I can’t change Keisei’s strategy
on my own.”
“Heh. I see. Well, that’s unfortunate,” said Kouenji, retaking his seat.
I didn’t know what he was planning, but I had no intention of going out
on a limb and trusting him. If he could decide to help on a whim, he could
change his mind back on a whim too. Kouenji had only promised to run the
minimum required distance. That meant he’d probably hold himself back if
he ran anything beyond those 1.2 kilometers. The proof was in how he’d
dodged the question I gave him about taking responsibility.
Besides, if I ended up causing us unnecessary trouble because of a
decision I made, there’d be hell to pay.
“It seems you’re cleverer than I thought. But also quite boring.”
If that was how he saw me, I was grateful for it.
I got out of the van and waited for Ishizaki at the marker 3.6 kilometers
from the finish line.
“Hey, Ayanokouji-kun.”
Naturally, there were other guys waiting there, too. Hirata greeted me.
“Huh, you’re not the anchor?” he asked.
“Nope. Kouenji is going last. What about you? Is Sudou your anchor?”
“Yeah. He’s raring to go—wants to run a lot. But with fifteen people,
that’s not really going to work.”
Sudou’s rivalry with Kouenji would probably flare up during the final
lap of the race.
“Personally, I wish we’d had more people,” I said. “It would probably
have made things a little easier.”
“At any rate, let’s both do our best. As long as we don’t fall below the
school’s standards, no one will be expelled, after all.”
“Yeah.”
215
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
While we waited, everyone was free to chat or quietly concentrate.
Since water stations were placed every 1.2 kilometers, it was also possible to
get a drink…though you increased your chances of a stomachache if you
guzzled down water before you ran. One student, totally oblivious to the
peril, sucked down the contents of a plastic water bottle.
“Ah, I’m so nervous,” he muttered before turning around and locking
eyes with me. It was the Professor. Maybe he wanted someone to talk to,
because he approached me. “So, you’re in this spot too, Ayanokouji-kun.”
“A-Ayanokouji-kun? In this spot…?”
I couldn’t believe my ears. The Professor I knew would have said
something like “Honorable Ayanokouji-dono, art thou currently placed upon
this land?”
“Ah. Well, I quit talking like that. I was doing it to play a character, but
after getting that warning during zazen, I thought I’d knock it off.”
“I see.”
I couldn’t hide my shock at hearing the Professor speak so normally. It
didn’t suit him at all. It was like the thing that made him him had
disappeared. He felt like a placeholder now, like Student X, or Y, or
whatever.
We went on to have a completely ordinary conversation, but to be
honest, I didn’t remember any of it. Guess just changing the way you talked
could make a huge difference.
At any rate, I wondered if Keisei had successfully passed the baton. No
matter how long it took, finishing the race was crucial. Cold as it might
sound, even if our large group did place dead last or fell below the school’s
standard line, no harm would come my way.
Of course, I did genuinely think it’d be better if no one got expelled.
As I wondered how many minutes had passed, I finally saw a student
coming our way. However, it wasn’t Ishizaki. It was someone from the
mostly Class B group led by Kanzaki. More students began to arrive, one
after the other. After a close struggle with the runner in third, Ishizaki was in
fourth.
“Huff huff. Take it, Ayanokouji! Go for first!” he shouted, handing the
216
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
baton over.
Whether we took first would come down to Kouenji, but I took the
baton and ran.
“I’ll kill ya if ya hold back!” shouted Ishizaki with the last of his
strength, before collapsing to the ground.
His exhaustion was natural, considering he’d run more than three
kilometers on a mountain path. I decided to slowly but surely close the gap
with the runners in front. I ran a little bit faster than everyone else, making
sure not to disrupt my breathing. Rather than trying to go on the offense right
off the bat pace, I waited for their stamina to drain before overtaking them.
By doing that, I fooled them into thinking I’d passed because they were too
slow.
Despite the bumpy terrain, two kilometers wasn’t enough to leave me
out of breath. Just like that, I overtook one runner ahead of me, putting me in
third, only a short distance behind the second-place runner. Then I handed the
baton off to Kouenji.
Nine people had handled this baton. Our fate was in this man’s hands.
“Now then. Let’s work up a light sweat, shall we?”
Kouenji, brushing back his hair, took the baton in hand and ran with a
nonchalant look on his face. He probably wasn’t going at full speed, but he
was quite fast. If he kept to that speed, we’d probably be fine. That was, of
course, so long as he didn’t slow to a stroll once he was out of sight.
In the end, despite all the anxiety he’d caused us, Kouenji wound up
finishing in second place. I didn’t know if he couldn’t overtake the runner in
first or if he simply didn’t want to. Probably the latter.
The speeches we’d have to give after this intense race were going to be
hell for the first-years. We’d have to speak at length in raised voices after
completely exhausting ourselves.
However, nothing particularly noteworthy occurred. While I had some
doubts about Kouenji’s somewhat…let’s say dramatic performance during
his speech, everyone seemed to have completed the assignment without any
real difficulty.

AND SO, the longest day of the special exam was over. The majority
of our group—no, of the entire student body—was totally exhausted. I had no
doubt that our group would score much higher than we’d initially expected. If
this came down to what the average scores were, then our group had a good
chance to finish strong. The rest came down to how well Nagumo’s group
and the third-years scored, but I was certain we wouldn’t score below the
threshold set by the school.
As on the first day, all the male students assembled inside the
gymnasium, shortly joined by the female students. They were probably going
to announce the results for both the guys and girls. It was already five o’clock
in the evening—safe to assume it would be late by the time we made it back
to school.
“You’ve all done excellent work at this camp school these past eight
days. Though the exact nature of the contents differ, of course, this special
exam is held every few years. Overall, you performed better than the students
from the previous exam. I suppose that’s down to your good teamwork,”
announced an elderly man I’d never seen before. He smiled the whole time
he spoke.
I was guessing he was the person in charge of the camp.
“I will announce the results, but first, I must say that the boys couldn’t
have had a better finish. They all successfully met the school’s standards, and
thus there will be zero boys expelled.”
The moment he announced that, I heard the relieved murmurs of
several boys.
“Whew, no one’s getting expelled,” said Keisei, putting his hand to his
chest with a sigh of relief. Ishizaki lightly smacked him on the back.
“Never once thought we’d get expelled from the start. We were aimin’
for first, after all.”
“Yeah.”
218
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
No matter our personal feelings, avoiding expulsion was significant.
However, the way the elderly man phrased that announcement was slightly
concerning. If no one from the entire student body was getting expelled, he’d
have no reason to specify “boys” the way he’d just done.
Which meant…
“Now then. I will announce the overall winner among the boys’ large
groups, but I will only be reading the name of the third-year student acting as
representative. Points for the students placed in that group, which includes
first- through third-year students, will be given at a later date.”
With that, the elderly man slowly read the names aloud.
“Third-year Class C Ninomiya Kuranosuke-kun’s group took first
place.”
When that announcement was made, some third-year students
immediately began to cheer. For a moment, I didn’t know whose group that
was, but then realized it was the large group that Horikita’s brother was in. It
would seem he’d won his battle against Nagumo.
“Well done, Horikita. Just what I’d expect of you.”
Fujimaki praised Horikita’s brother, ignoring the rest of the
announcements. The groups that came in second place and below were
announced, but from the senior students’ point of view, this was nothing
more than a bonus.
“Hey, Yukimura. We got second. We did it!”
“Yeah, I’m glad. I’m really, really glad.”
They didn’t announce the actual difference in our scores, but
Nagumo’s group had come in second place, so I was guessing the margin had
been narrow. Everyone seemed to think Nagumo would quiet down a little
now that he’d placed second, but honestly, I wasn’t sure whose strategy
would carry the day in the end.
Why was that? Well, I didn’t have anything particular at stake here,
but…Nagumo was smiling beside me, showing no sign of being upset at all.
That wasn’t the look of a man who’d lost after dramatically and defiantly
throwing down the gauntlet.
I supposed I expected as much. Expected, in other words, that he was
219
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
concocting something incredibly evil behind the scenes.
“You’ve earned first place. Congratulations are in order, Horikita-
senpai. Just as I’d expect from you,” said Nagumo, speaking loudly.
Horikita didn’t offer any kind of response. He simply stayed silent for
the rest of the announcements. Maybe he was also beginning to feel
something was off about this.
“You lost, Nagumo,” said the third-year student Fujimaki, clearly
oblivious to what was going on. He probably felt he’d just served a cocky
junior student a piece of humble pie.
“It sure seems that way. But they’ve only just started announcing the
results, haven’t they?” replied Nagumo.
“Enough already. It’s over.”
“Sure. For the boys.”
“For the boys? Well, yeah, but the girls have nothing to do with this.
That was the agreement, wasn’t it, Nagumo?”
“Yes. They have nothing to do with the fight between Horikita-senpai
and I, that’s right. At all.”
Fujimaki’s face turned stern upon hearing Nagumo’s enigmatic choice
of words. Ishikura, a third-year student from Class B, stood beside Nagumo
and listened to the conversation, quietly observing what was happening.
“Next, I would like to announce the results for the girls’ groups. First
place goes to third-year Class C Ayase Natsu-san’s group.”
This time, some of the girls let out cheers of joy. The large group that
the third-year student named Ayase was in charge of contained a small group
composed mostly of first-year Class C students, including Horikita and
Kushida. They might have earned quite a few points.
But the joy was short-lived. Something dire came close on its heels.
“Um, well… This is truly regrettable, but unfortunately, there is one
small group among the girls that failed to secure the necessary score.”
Everyone’s faces froze upon hearing that. Even the students who’d
been cheering went silent. Everyone had tried their absolute best not to fall
below the borderline. However, life can be cruel. Someone was definitely
220
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
going to be expelled.
Now the only question that remained was: Would be a first-year
getting expelled? Or perhaps an upperclassman? Horikita’s brother looked
over at Nagumo as though he had just noticed something. Like he was trying
to discern the meaning behind the cocksure smile that Nagumo had worn on
his face this entire time.
However, it was already too late.
“I will first announce the group that came in last place… That would
be the group represented by third-year Class B student Ikari Momoko-san.”
Just like with the boys, it wasn’t immediately clear to me who was
included in that group. But the anguished cries from some of the girls began
to make things clear. The large group that had come in last place had been
decided. Now it was just a matter of which of the small groups within it had
fallen below the acceptable threshold. In a worst-case scenario, students from
all three grade levels might be expelled at the same time.
“As for the group that fell below the threshold…”
The gymnasium grew even quieter than during zazen. Everyone’s eyes
were focused on the old man’s mouth, desperate to know the results.
“It is also…”
The gymnasium was divided into two camps: those who continued
smiling, and those who were getting nervous.
“The group Ikari Momoko-san represents. That is all.”
The moment the old man declared the results, Nagumo started laughing
happily, as if he had been holding it in until now. The passage of time, which
had slowed to a trickle, started to flow normally once more. However, many
of the students didn’t seem to understand what was happening. Why was
Nagumo laughing because some student he didn’t even know was going to be
ordered to leave the school?
One student from third-year Class B was going to be expelled. But he
was laughing because…that wasn’t all there was to this.
“What did you do, Nagumo?!” shouted Fujimaki, who now understood
what was going on. He closed in on Nagumo.
221
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Horikita’s brother didn’t approach Nagumo, but he wore a grim look.
“Come now, senpai, we’re still in the middle of the results. Please calm
down. This has nothing to do with you anyway, Fujimaki-senpai. Does it?
The only thing that’s happening is that a Class B student will be expelled.
If anything, this means you’ll pull even further ahead of your rivals, right?”
Nagumo snickered.
“Um, please, some quiet, if you would. Now, it is truly unfortunate, but
this means Ikari-san will have to take responsibility for the group, and thus,
she will be expelled. Ikari-san may also decide to invoke the solidarity rule
and name someone else within her group. Ikari-san, please consult with me
later. Next, I will announce which of the girls’ groups has taken second
place.”
Despite saying that it was unfortunate, he continued speaking,
solemnly. But Horikita’s brother no longer cared about getting first place
himself. He’d fallen for the trap set for him, just like Nagumo had intended. It
was precisely because Horikita Manabu was an upstanding, honorable
individual that he’d got beaten by Nagumo Miyabi, who’d struck from where
you’d least expect it.
“Ayanokouji, why is Fujimaki-senpai so angry…? Just like Nagumo-
senpai said, the representative is a student from Class B. Isn’t this a boon for
Class A?” Keisei whispered into my ear.
“No, the problem isn’t the representative. I think it’s who’s going
down with her.”
“Huh?”
We were ordered to disband. While they prepped the buses for our
return trip, we were given free time to change. Nagumo stood his ground
proudly. He called one of the girls over.
“Ikari-senpai. I’m sure everyone is wondering just who in the world
will be expelled alongside you.”
The third-year Class B girl named Ikari, who was slated for expulsion,
was calm. If anything, it was the other girls in her small group, which was
mostly composed of students from Class B and Class D, who looked worried.
I knew what was going to happen. I was certain of it, thanks to the
222
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
information I’d gotten from Asahina and Kei.
And among the people in that group…there was one single participant
from A Class: Tachibana Akane. I looked over at Horikita’s brother and
slowly spoke to him inside my mind.
Look, I get it. To ensure that you all graduated from Class A, and also
to counter Nagumo, you instructed every Class A student, both guys and
girls, not to take on the role of representative. Didn’t you? Because as long
as you produced solid scores, none of you would get expelled.
However, you knew that wasn’t an airtight defense. That was why you
accepted Nagumo’s challenge, making sure to set the conditions that the fight
be above the board, in an attempt to defend against his malice. You also
avoided making any imprudent contact with the girls, hoping to lower the risk
of Nagumo exploiting that opening and targeting them.
You exhausted every measure available to you, and still kept things
civil, I’ll grant you that. But even so, Nagumo’s malice knows no bounds. I
don’t need to say much more about that, though.
This special exam was a trap that Nagumo had set without even the
school realizing it. The people who had gotten caught in his trap understood
the situation they were in now. Their faces had gone so pale that it looked
like they might collapse any moment.
“Well, isn’t that obvious? It’s the student who made sure our group
knew no peace. Tachibana Akane-san, from Class A,” spat Ikari angrily,
speaking loud enough for everyone to hear.
“Nagumo… You promised Horikita that you wouldn’t involve any
third parties in this, didn’t you?” shouted Fujimaki. He rounded on Nagumo,
getting in his face, like he was about to start throwing punches.
“Please wait. This has nothing to do with me.”
“That’s a bald-faced lie!”
Fujimaki was furious, and it was obvious why. No one here was
fooled. Nagumo had known what was going on.
“Well, I’ll go notify the school who I’ll be dragging down with me,”
announced Ikari indifferently, heading off toward the instructor. Her
classmate Ishikura went with her, nestling close.
223
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
No one could do anything to stop what was happening. Even
Hashimoto recognized that.
“Tachibana-senpai dragged down Ikari-senpai’s group,” he said. “As a
result, their group’s score fell below the average, so she’s being taken down
as well via the solidary rule. That’s all there is to it, isn’t it?”
Unlike Fujimaki, Horikita’s brother called over to Tachibana, who
stood still, before he approached Nagumo. Some of the third-year students
walked away, the looks on their faces indicating that they couldn’t even bring
themselves to say anything in the current situation.
“Horikita-kun, I’m sorry…!”
“Tachibana, why didn’t you consult with me sooner? Surely you
should have noticed something was amiss.”
“That’s because…I knew that you would take the burden upon
yourself, Horikita-kun…” said Tachibana, apologizing, in tears.
She likely hadn’t noticed at first. How she’d been caught in a trap from
the moment the groups were decided. But as time passed, she must have
sensed something was wrong…sensed that the group she had been placed in
was created for the sole purpose of taking down Tachibana Akane.
And still, she’d faced the exam, working as hard as she could in hopes
of a miracle. But as you might expect, reality was cruel. Still, Tachibana
should have been prepared to accept this. Even if she was expelled, it would
only cost Class A one hundred class points.
224

225
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Ah, such beautiful friendship. Or perhaps I should call it love?
Anyway, congratulations to you, Horikita-senpai. Once again, please allow
me to pay you my compliments. I’ve lost.”
A loser would never speak in the tone of voice Nagumo did now. I
doubted there was a single person here who believed what he said.
“It was a truly fantastic strategy. No, perhaps I should say that it was a
strategy that went well beyond what is expected. There is not a single person
here who can read my intentions, and that includes you, Horikita-senpai,”
said Nagumo. He laughed loudly, not ceasing his attacks on his injured
opponent. “Please, enlighten me, Tachibana-senpai. How does it feel to have
served on the student council, to have been on verge of graduating from Class
A, only to then be expelled? And Horikita-senpai, how do you feel right
now? I’m sure you must be positively filled with feelings of frustration, the
likes of which you’ve never felt before. Hmm?”
After hearing what Nagumo said, Horikita sighed quietly.
“Why didn’t you go after me?” he asked.
“Because I can’t imagine you ever being expelled, even if I tried such a
method on you, senpai. I was terrified you’d counter me with some method I
couldn’t anticipate. But more importantly, I’ve never actually wanted you to
be expelled, Horikita-senpai. If anything, if you got expelled, then we
wouldn’t be able to see each other, would we? That’s why, of all the many
possible targets, I went after Tachibana-senpai. I wanted to see your face
when I made her disappear,” said Nagumo. He laughed as he said it, as
though implying he’d done it purely for curiosity’s sake, or on a whim.
“I understand that we have very different principles, but I trusted you.
Regarding the matter of competition, I had thought you were a man capable
of facing me directly, head-to-head. It would appear that I was wrong,” said
Horikita.
Nagumo apparently took no offense to this.
“Trust is an awful lot like experience points in a game,” he said. “The
more you accumulate, the more you increase your worth. I think that the
ultimate form of this is family. If you ran into a stranger when you were out
and about at night, you’d be cautious. But if that person happened to be
family, then you’d drop your guard. It’s like that, Horikita-senpai. Though I
226
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
feel you don’t like me very much, I’ve managed to gain a certain degree of
your trust over these past two years. Even though our values were different,
I’ve always done everything that I said I would do. I followed your
instructions and stuck to the rules. That being said, you are a rather canny
upperclassman. I’m sure you didn’t trust me completely, did you?”
It was safe to assume that Nagumo knew the orders that Horikita’s
brother had issued his class to protect them and collect information.
“However…even if you had your suspicions about me, it wasn’t as
though you could betray me first, senpai,” added Nagumo.
That was the downside of a nonaggressive defense policy.
“You’ve lost something rather significant because of your curiosity,
Nagumo.”
“Oh, you mean your trust? I chose to discard that myself. For the sake
of trying to gain an understanding of my senpai, who cares so deeply for his
juniors.”
Nagumo had proven that he cared nothing for promises. He wanted to
fight without limiting factors such as trust and respect. That was the kind of
challenge he was offering.
“I’ve come to understand how you do things quite well,” said Horikita
Manabu.
“I’m glad to hear that. This was, after all, nothing more than a warm-
up,” replied Nagumo. “I’m fine with getting people expelled, if I have to.
That’s the way this school operates.”
While everyone else panicked, Horikita continued to speak calmly.
“You seem to be operating under the impression that Tachibana will be
expelled.”
“W-wait, Horikita-kun!” Tachibana shouted.
But there was a fierce determination in Horikita’s eyes.
“Oh, ho? I thought we were going to end with a draw, both of us losing
something. But you’re really gonna spend all that? I mean, that would mean a
lot of money and class points.”
Revocation of expulsion. The ultimate tool that anyone could use, as

long as they met the requirements.
“Please, don’t do this. This is all my fault…”
Tachibana desperately tried to stop Horikita. However, it seemed
Fujimaki shared Horikita’s opinion, as he addressed Class A.
“We understand. We’ve made it this far as Class A because we
understand it better than anyone else. Isn’t that right?”
“That’s exactly right, Horikita. No need to hold back. Use it.”
Some of their classmates spoke up to voice their support.
“Are you really okay with this, Horikita-senpai? For a third-year class
to save a student from expulsion right now would mean essentially giving up
your position as Class A, you know?”
“Even if we give up our position, all we need to do is take it back
again. As you said, that’s how this school operates.”
“Is that so? Well, I guess that’s fine.”
Miyabi was probably going to amicably discuss the strategy he had in
mind from this point onward. I already knew what that strategy was. There
was no need for me to stay and hang on to every word.
Besides, there was nothing I could do, even if I stayed.
Horikita Suzune had anxiously watched the entire situation unfold,
from beginning to end. She was looking so intently at her older brother that
she didn’t even notice me as I walked away, which was fine by me.
I left the gymnasium. When I did, I saw Kei standing near the entrance,
looking like she was waiting for me. As I stepped out into the corridor, she
followed a little way behind me.
“Everything happened the way you said it would, Kiyotaka. You
seriously knew what was going to happen. You knew Tachibana-senpai
would be targeted. I would have thought anyone other than Horikita-senpai
would’ve been fair game for Nagumo to target…”
“It was the rules of the special exam,” I said. “As soon as I heard the
student council was involved in its planning, I thought this might happen. It’s
certainly true that anyone could have been targeted. However, Nagumo went
through the trouble of setting up a trap this complex. If he wanted to stick the
228
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
knife in as deep as possible, his targets were limited. The only female student
that Horikita had a deep connection with was Tachibana.”
That was the conclusion I’d drawn after piecing together information
from Kei, Ichinose, and Asahina. Also, there was a clear sense of collusion
going on between Nagumo and Ishikura. It was clear those two were
connected. Nagumo hadn’t just gathered all the second-year students under
his wing. He’d also brought all the third-year students who weren’t in Class
A over to his side.
“I’m sure everyone in the large group colluded to get a low score. The
members of Tachibana’s small group must’ve been holding back quite a bit,
too. That way, it was simple for them to fall below the threshold.”
But Kei didn’t seem quite convinced.
“But why did he use Class B? It would’ve been fine if he put a Class D
student in charge as representative. I mean, since he used Class B, that means
Horikita-senpai is still in Class A, right? If Nagumo wanted to knock him
down to Class B, shouldn’t he have gone with a Class D student?”
Kei had a good eye. She was certainly right about that. If that was
Nagumo’s goal, it would’ve been an excellent strategy for him to make a
Class D student the representative, thereby lessening the gap between Class
A and Class B that way. Or so you’d assume, normally.
“It’s precisely because it was Class B that this was possible. If
Tachibana acquitted her tasks during this special exam without issue, it
wouldn’t be easy to get her expelled via the solidarity rule. Unless the three
classes all came together, the strategy wouldn’t be viable. Let’s consider
third-year Class D. They’re the least likely to make it to Class A before
graduation, given their current situation. If a student from Class D was the
representative, they might decide to name a student from B or C to take down
with them in order to move their class up, even if it’s just by one level. But it
would be pointless to drag down a student from a lower class at this
juncture.”
On the other hand, if you looked at it from the perspective of Class D
or Class C students who weren’t the representative, they’d probably be happy
to help bring down students from Class A and Class B. That was why Ikari’s
group had banded together to thoroughly demonize Tachibana, making her
out to be the bad guy. If anything, they probably blatantly and maliciously
229
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
harassed her. Tachibana probably hadn’t been able to sleep at night.
And as a result, they didn’t get good grades in the end. Even if their
average grade was mediocre, if it appeared Tachibana had held the group
back for the entire week, that would be enough to paint her as a target.
If someone filed a complaint, there would’ve been a discussion. But if
the entire small group conspired to claim that Tachibana had been an obstacle
for them in places and in ways that weren’t publicly visible, the school would
have to recognize that. Of course, it would set a bad precedent, but there
would probably be some amendments made to the rules for the next special
exam in a few years.
And so Nagumo’s elaborate strategy had come together, and he’d
successfully laid the way for Tachibana to be expelled.
“But wait, how could he even pull off a strategy like this? If I were a
student in Class B, I sure as hell wouldn’t be okay with getting expelled for
the sake of my class. What’s the payoff?”
“I’m not sure what kind of payoff there was, but Ikari won’t be
expelled.”
“Huh? But she was the representative, wasn’t she?”
“They probably predicted Horikita’s brother would use that lifeline
option. By paying twenty million points and three hundred Class Points, he
can revoke a student’s expulsion. Because Horikita used that option, Nagumo
was okay with Class B using it too.”
“Well, now I can’t tell what he gained from all this. If anything, isn’t it
a loss?”
“Spending those class points will sting, but if Class A had to use the
same lifeline, the gap between the classes won’t widen at all. As far as private
points go, this won’t hurt them at all.”
“So third-year Class B is that rich?”
“No. The ironclad condition of Nagumo’s strategy was that he would
pay all the private points himself. If he didn’t, there’s no way they’d
cooperate.”
Most likely, Nagumo had contacted Ishikura on the bus and paid him
the twenty million points in advance. The proof of that could be seen in
230
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Ikari’s and Ishikura’s calm behavior.
“The second-year class is a monolith. If he collected money from the
entirety of the second-years, he wouldn’t even need fifteen thousand per
person. Saving one student from expulsion could be bought on the cheap.”
“What a seriously insane way of fighting. That is definitely not
normal.”
“That’s how Nagumo Miyabi does things. That’s all there is to it.”
He didn’t come up with a strategy after seeing what the exam was like.
He came up with a strategy and then created the exam. Class A, led by
Horikita’s brother, would get stuck with paying twenty million private points
in total, as a single class. Quite a bit of damage. They might have to face one
or two more special exams before they graduated, and they’d just lost a
staggering amount of money.
If Horikita’s brother were expelled in the next exam, he wouldn’t have
enough money to save himself. That lifeline would be dead in the water.
“I think it’s time we head our separate ways.”
“Wait, one more thing.” Kei was persistent. “I can’t think of any way
to counter the way Nagumo-senpai’s thinks. The method he used to set
Tachibana-senpai up for expulsion… It’s, like, the perfect trap or something.
Is that why you didn’t make a move, Kiyotaka?”
“It’s quite a formidable strategy. Nagumo had a checkmate set up by
the time his enemy got in the game.”
This was a good precedent to set. Private points could be powerful.
“Say, what if I wind up in the same situation that Tachibana-senpai
was in…? In a situation where you can’t even use a lifeline? I mean, there’d
be nothing you could do at a time like that, right?” asked Kei in a soft voice.
“You don’t even need me to answer, do you? I won’t let you get
expelled. No matter what methods I have to use.”
In the end, Horikita Manabu chose to part with Class A’s class and
private points, thus saving Tachibana Akane. As I’d predicted, Ishikura from
Class B did the same to save Ikari. An extremely unusual happenstance: two
classes utilizing the lifeline option at the same time.

From this point on, students across all grade levels at the Advanced
Nurturing High School were going to be expelled, one after another.

Postscript
 
HEY, IT’S THE GUY who says “Next time for sure!” deep within his
heart when announcing the next volume, only for it to end up being late
again: Kinugasa.
Considering nothing ever goes as planned, even I’ve started to get
annoyed with myself. “I’ll release it any day! Any day now!” I always make
those announcements, and there’s always a delay. Truly terrible, isn’t it?
And so I will state clearly and unequivocally: I will stop making
declarations about release dates in the postscript.
It’s been about seven or eight weeks since I’ve hurt my fingers, I
think? Even though that much time has passed, I’m still a ways off from a
full recovery. I’m still receiving treatment and trying to take care of myself,
wondering if I can maintain the four-month schedule I’ve been on until now.
Anyhow, before I even noticed, it was already May. Time really does
fly, doesn’t it? Time has passed in the blink of an eye, considering it’s been a
full three years since I first released Classroom of the Elite. Back when I was
working on volume 1, part of me didn’t believe I’d be able to go on selling
my works and writing for this long. I’m extremely delighted. But I’ve also
become keenly aware that it’s not just my fingers that are aching. My entire
body is falling apart. I’m really going to take better care of myself.
In volume 8 of Classroom, we started seeing more of the
upperclassmen. A wide variety of characters showed up: the good-for-
nothings, the shady, and the dependable. I hope you enjoyed reading this
volume. And the next volume, volume 9, well, it, nnngh, will c-come out in
S-S-Sept…aagghh. No, I’ve already decided to stop making announcements!
Stop!
All right, that’s enough of my idiocy. You know, personally, there’s
one thing I’ve really wanted for a long time now. I guess you could call it a
secret desire. I really want a massage chair. Like, really, really want it. But
it’s expensive. On top of that, it would take up a lot of space that I don’t
have.
233
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Seriously, I’ve been agonizing over this for years. In the end, I can’t
decide. Will I ever buy one? Or will that day never come? Well, no matter
how much time passes, I’ll continue to write about wanting it and never buy
it. If anyone out there knows about some wonderful massage chairs, please
tell me about it.
