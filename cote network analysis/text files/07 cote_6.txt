Chapter 1:
Kushida Kikyou’s Soliloquy
 
Do people live according to their own ideals, I wonder? Well, I do.
I’ve become my ideal self. Other girls acknowledge that I’ve been blessed
with a wonderful figure, my memory is sharper than most people’s, and I’m
academically gifted. I’m good at sports and confident in my conversational
skills. I have pawns at my disposal, I’m shrewd, and I’m adaptable to any
situation.
Wouldn’t you say I’m perfect?
Of course, I wouldn’t say that I am. There are girls cuter than me, and
many who are smarter or more athletic. That’s obvious. Yes, that’s quite
obvious. However, it’s also fair to say that most people hate to lose. Whether
it be a question of looks, academic performance, singing, or even video
games, it’s only natural to feel frustrated when you lose to someone else at
something you excel at.
I hate losing far more than the average person does.
Every time I lose to someone I know, it shakes me to my core. Every
loss deepens the darkness inside my heart. I once vomited from the intense
emotional stress that losing caused me.
Reality is cruel. I know I’m not average, but I’m not a genius, either.
When I was a child, people fawned over me every time I completed even a
small task. They called me a genius, a wunderkind. It felt wonderful. It made
my heart dance.
I was the best at everything—until I started junior high. Then people
began to overtake me in multiple aspects. I just couldn’t beat certain
opponents, and that ate at me, so I searched for an escape. I wanted
something that I could never lose at. I wanted people to respect and envy me.
I couldn’t achieve that in academics or sports. So, I decided I’d get
people to trust me instead. They’d love me more than anyone else. I would
extend my hand in friendship to disgusting, asocial boys, and to girls
unattractive and bitter enough to turn anyone’s stomach. I suppressed my real
Page 1

emotions and wore a smile, exuding false kindness.
I became really popular. I was loved by my classmates, by both
upperclassmen and underclassmen, by my teachers and guardians, even by
strangers. When it came to likeability, I was unparalleled.
Trustworthy people receive access to secrets. When people find
someone they can truly trust, they lay themselves bare. I racked up that
currency. I learned everything from the secret desires of the most popular boy
in class to the smartest kid’s secret troubles. I obtained information both
insignificant and gravely serious.
Every time someone confided in me, my heart danced with joy.
Every time someone trusted me with information that meant the world
to them, I shook with delight. I was trusted—the most trustworthy person
around. That became my reason for being. But my power came from living a
life of lies. I spent my days being slowly crushed by the weight of that stress.
Then…that incident happened. Well, that’s not quite true. The incident
didn’t “happen.” Someone made it happen.
But there was nothing I could have done, anyway. Everyone had
rejected me by then.
If you hurt someone, you can’t complain when they hurt you back. If
someone hurts you, you pay them back in kind. That’s only natural, right?
Still, the ideal persona I’d constructed for myself shattered. The respect
and envy people felt for me disappeared, replaced by fear and hate.
That wasn’t what I wanted.
I only wanted one thing.
I wanted to be everyone’s favorite. To feel that sense of superiority
once more.
I promised myself I’d never go through that again. I swore to myself
that it wouldn’t happen. As I thought about my new life in high school, my
heart pounded in excitement.
This time, I would succeed.
But the beginning of my new life turned out to be a disaster. On the
first day of high school, I bumped into Horikita Suzune on the bus.

She knew about the incident.
As long as she was here, I’d never have peace.

Chapter 2:
The Changing Class D
 
The sports festival was over.
It was mid-October, and getting chilly outside. The student council
held an election, complete with a ceremony to honor the outgoing members
and swear in the new ones afterward. That event was significant, with the
entire student body assembled in the gymnasium, but most first-year students
couldn’t have cared less. They nearly fell asleep during the ceremony,
quieting their breathing so that the teachers and upperclassmen wouldn’t
notice them.
“President Horikita has some final remarks he’d like to share with you
all.”
The moderator stood aside as Horikita Manabu slowly took the stage
and approached the microphone. Once, the younger Horikita would have
shrunk back in fear at the sight of her brother. Now, she remained steadfast as
she watched him leave his position so that the new president could be sworn
in.
“I’m very proud to have led the student council for nearly two years.
I’m also quite grateful. Thank you all very much,” Horikita’s older brother
said to the crowd. His address was brief and unemotional, delivered with the
air of a solemn obligation, and he retreated to his original position once it was
done.
The ceremony didn’t end there. The other student council officers
remained on the stage. “President Horikita, thank you for all your hard work.
Now then, we’d like to welcome Nagumo Miyabi, a second-year Class A and
the next student council president, to say a few words.”
Nagumo walked onstage and stood in front of the microphone.
Ichinose, a first year, was among the student council members who watched
him attentively.
“Hello. I’m Nagumo, second-year Class A. Student Council President
Horikita, I sincerely appreciate the strict yet kind guidance you’ve shown me.
Page 5
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
I’d like to express my respect for you, while also emphasizing what an honor
it’s been to serve alongside the most capable president in this school’s
history. You’ve exhibited the strongest leadership possible.”
Nagumo bowed his head deeply toward Horikita’s brother. Then he
faced the student body once more.
“Allow me to introduce myself again. My name is Nagumo Miyabi,
and I will be assuming the position of student council president at the Tokyo
Metropolitan Advanced Nurturing High School. I sincerely look forward to
working with all of you.”
Nagumo had behaved enigmatically during the sports festival. Now, he
was the picture of politeness. However, that courtesy didn’t last long. He
donned a small, thin smile, and the atmosphere changed almost immediately.
“This may be sudden, but for my first order of business, I pledge to
change the term length for student council members, as well as the general
election method. The previous student council president held the general
election in October instead of December each year. This arrangement, which
saw the next generation of leaders move into their roles early, yielded mixed
results. Therefore, the new student council has determined that it’s time to
take things a step further. From now on, the student council president and
officers will have indefinite terms while attending school, so that they may
serve continuously until graduation. At the same time, we’ll annul both the
current general-election system, and any restrictions on the student council’s
size. The council will constantly accept new officers. In other words, an
excellent candidate may join the student council no matter how many people
are currently on it. Also, if someone is determined to be unfit for office, they
can be removed by a majority vote. Please allow me to confirm this to all
students, teachers, and student council members who served under the
previous president. To bring this school into the future, I intend to thoroughly
destroy the past.”
Nagumo spoke forcefully, as if he meant his remarks to deny the
achievements of the previous student council president, who still stood right
behind him.
“I wanted to implement these changes at once. Unfortunately, a newly
elected president must deal with many obligations and restrictions first.”
Nagumo glanced at Horikita, then immediately turned back to the student
Page 6

body. “A revolution is coming. Students with real ability will rise to the top,
and students without any will fall. I intend to turn this school into a true
meritocracy, so please, give me everything you’ve got. I look forward to
seeing what you can do.”
The entire gymnasium had been silent during his announcement, but as
soon as he finished speaking, almost every second-year student shouted with
sheer delight. Apparently, there was some kind of tension between the second
and third-year students that we first years didn’t know about.

2.1
 
The second semester continued.
My surroundings changed bit by bit. Class D had made it through
major events like the uninhabited island and the sports festival, and slowly
but surely, we were coming together as a class. People’s friend circles
gradually expanded, and they began to show marked academic improvement.
Even our problem child, Sudou, was changing for the better. Before the
sports festival, he’d slept through class as if it were no big deal. Now, he
actually took notes, probably because Horikita checked in on him after. He
still got sleepy on occasion, but that was probably because he put in intense
practice for the basketball club. He also softened his rough treatment of Ike
and Yamauchi.
Sudou was maturing, and people’s opinions of him began to improve.
However, he wasn’t the only one changing. I saw it in myself, too.
Whether that was a good or bad thing remained to be seen.
“Are you by yourself?” someone asked, pulling me from my musings.
“Is it bad to be by myself?” I asked.
Horikita appeared to chuckle at me. “Your dear friends Ike-kun and
Yamauchi-kun haven’t been inviting you out much. Isn’t that right?”
Ike and Yamauchi had left the classroom with the Professor in tow,
heading toward Keyaki Mall. I thought I’d maintained a Buddha-like calm,
but Horikita apparently saw through me. Yeah. After the sports festival, my
two closest friends had invited me to hang out much less often. Actually, it
was more like they’d completely cut me out.
“It’s hardly surprising,” Horikita said. “They used to think that all of
you were in the same terrible-student boat. Then they discovered that you
were actually hiding remarkable physical ability.”
“What remarkable physical ability? I’m kind of fast on my feet, that’s
all.”
“Very fast, especially for a student. Besides, they probably noticed that
Page 8
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
you scored much higher than average when you measured your grip strength.
You understand, don’t you? People tend to fundamentally resent those who
excel. In your case, though, they resent you because you concealed your
excellence.” Horikita sighed. “Well, enjoy your life of solitude.”
With that sarcastic remark, she left, her long hair swaying as she exited
the classroom. Even though she was usually all alone, too, her dignified
conduct was worth at least a little respect.
As Horikita left, Karuizawa cast a strange look in my direction.
However, as our gazes met, she moved her eyes away again. There was
clearly some meaning in the look, but she followed it by getting up and
leaving right behind Horikita.
Karuizawa’s short, fluttering skirt caught my attention. It was a little
shorter than the other students’ skirts. In cases like those, one or two
centimeters made all the difference in the world.
“What’s she…? Well, whatever,” I muttered to myself.
“Hey, Ayanokouji-kun.”
I didn’t know Satou’s first name. She was the same kind of fashionable
gyaru as Karuizawa. She got along with Ike and Yamauchi, but she and I
hardly ever talked. It seemed as though Satou wanted the kind of social clout
Kushida had, but she wasn’t all that popular with the guys, though Ike
described her as “the sort of girl who’s used to being around guys.”
Right now, Satou seemed to have been waiting to get me alone. She
glanced around the room as if anxious.
“Do you need something?” I asked. I didn’t know what else to say.
“Uh, yeah. Several things, I guess.” She evaded the question. I couldn’t
guess what she was getting at. “Well, it’s like this. Can I borrow you for a
bit? I want to talk.”
This was strange. I steeled myself and put up my guard. It was easier to
summon up the courage to accept her request than to summon up the courage
to turn her down.
“Well, it’s just…” Satou began. “Is it okay to do this somewhere else?”
Before I could answer, though, she got up and walked out of the classroom.
I followed her.
Page 9
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Just as I left, Sakura made a sound, as if she wanted to say something.
“Ah…” However, no words came out of her mouth. She didn’t follow me,
either.
Satou and I went into the passage that led to the gymnasium. It would
probably be crowded after lunch, but since everyone was off eating right
now, it was an ideal place to talk. She clearly didn’t want anyone else to
witness this.
Satou stopped in her tracks and looked over her shoulder. “I’m going
to ask you something odd… Ayanokouji-kun, are you going out with
anyone?”
“Uhh, what do you mean?” I asked.
“I mean exactly what it sounds like. I’m asking you if you have a
girlfriend. Do you?”
The answer was “no.” Though saying as much would reveal just how
unpopular I was, I couldn’t exactly lie. “I don’t.”
“Hmm. I see. Well, does that mean you’re looking for a girlfriend right
now?”
She didn’t ask it like she was making fun of me, or inquiring out of
pity. Actually, she had a small smile, as if she was happy. I started to
understand where our conversation was headed. Was this a trap? I looked
around, but saw no sign of anyone watching.
Why the sudden interest in me? Maybe this had something to do with
what Horikita meant when she said I was fast?
“If you’re okay with starting out as friends, then… Well, how about we
exchange phone numbers?” Satou asked.
Page 10
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Page 11
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
This was… Well, it was halfway to a romantic confession. I had never
imagined I would receive a proposal like this from a girl, but I couldn’t really
come up with a reason to refuse.
“All right,” I said. “Sure.”
“Okay. Got it.” Once I entered Satou into my contacts, the words
“registration complete” displayed on my phone screen. Having more girls in
my contacts was amazing. After I put Satou’s number in my phone, there was
a strange feeling of tranquility in the air.
“This might be kind of blunt, but why did you suddenly want my
contact info?” I asked.
Satou blushed and averted her eyes. “Why? Well, it’s just…the sports
festival, the relay. I guess you looked so incredibly cool, Ayanokouji-kun. Or
I guess it’s that I just never noticed you before now…like you were
completely off my radar. I thought the best guy in class was, you know,
Hirata-kun. But since he’s Karuizawa-san’s boyfriend, there’s nothing I can
do about that, right?”
Satou looked back up at me, seeming almost panicked.
“Uh, I’m not saying I think you’re worse than Hirata-kun or anything
like that, Ayanokouji-kun. To be honest, after getting a good look at you,
you’re even cooler than Hirata-kun, and more mature and gentler, too. S-so,
anyway, that’s…”
I didn’t hear the end of her sentence, since she chose that time to turn
and run like the wind. I stood completely still, unable to wrap my head
around what had just happened.
I’d received a romantic confession from an unexpected person, at an
unexpected time, in an unexpected place. No one can see the future, it’s true,
but I could never have imagined this. What was I even supposed to do? I
didn’t feel anything for Satou, good or bad. In fact, I saw her only as a
classmate, nothing more. So, should I have turned her down?
Then again, Satou hadn’t said that she wanted to go out with me or that
she liked me. All she did was ask whether I had a girlfriend, and if we could
exchange phone numbers. She’d added that she wanted to “start out as
friends.” If I turned her down, she could just say I misunderstood her. That
Page 12
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
would be embarrassing.
It was one thing to observe romance as a bystander, but it was weird to
be confessed to. Now I understood how Sakura had felt back when Yamauchi
said that he liked her.
As I made my way back to the building, conflicted, I bumped into
Katsuragi and Yahiko from Class A. I planned to just walk by, but Katsuragi
stopped in his tracks and said to Yahiko, “Sorry, but you go on ahead. I have
a little something to discuss with Ayanokouji.”
Yahiko immediately nodded and agreed to Katsuragi’s orders.
“Horikita isn’t with you,” Katsuragi said.
“It’s not like we’re joined at the hip,” I replied. Talking to other guys
was much easier than talking to girls. I felt like an idiot for struggling so hard
to make friends.
“I suppose that’s true. I just wanted to say that I was surprised by your
performance in the sports festival’s final relay. I doubt anyone could’ve
expected it,” he said.
“Class D won’t always be the losers,” I said.
“Perhaps. But most of your own classmates looked shocked, too.
Unless everyone in your class is a talented actor, it appears that few of them
knew how fast you are.”
In the midst of all that chaos, Katsuragi had observed me closely. He
was conscientious like that.
“Imagine whatever you like,” I told him.
“No matter. I didn’t think I’d get anything more from you.”
“You thought you’d only get a little bit of information from the
enemy? Or are you saying Class A will never see Class D as a threat?” I
asked.
Katsuragi looked slightly troubled. “I have enough problems right now.
I simply can’t afford to focus on other classes,” he said.
“You told Horikita to be wary of Ryuuen, though.”
“He’ll do anything for the sake of winning. Even if that means
resorting to blackmail or violence.”
Page 13
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Ryuuen wasn’t the only person Katsuragi feared. He also had to be on
his guard around Sakayanagi Arisu, another Class A power player, but I
wasn’t going to bring that up. Sakayanagi was a mysterious student who
knew me. If I stirred the pot, it might not end well for me.
“Blackmail and violence, huh? Sounds like Ryuuen would be in
trouble if the school found out.”
“He’s a clever person,” Katsuragi replied. “Please warn Horikita not to
underestimate him. I understand why you may not trust me, but Ryuuen is
everyone’s enemy.”
Yes, but there was evidence that Katsuragi teamed up with Ryuuen at
one point. I wasn’t sure whether I could trust Katsuragi, and he seemed to
sense my feelings. “You don’t believe me?”
I decided to probe further. “To be honest, I’m not sure I do. I can’t tell
you my source, but there are rumors that you worked with Ryuuen. Is that
wrong?”
“Where did you hear that? Well, I suppose that doesn’t matter. I regret
it. Even though I felt that I had no other options at the time, I should never
have gotten involved with Ryuuen. That’s precisely why I’m warning you.”
Katsuragi’s words were persuasive. “I should’ve known the risks of teaming
up with him.”
“So, you want to join forces against Ryuuen?” I asked.
Katsuragi quietly chuckled to himself. He seemed tense, so I asked
something else.
“I understand that you’re wary of Ryuuen, but isn’t that mainly Class
A and Class B’s problem? I saw the class point totals back in October,” I told
him.
Katsuragi pursed his lips. After the uninhabited-island test, Class A
saw their points increase to 1,124. However, their points fell during the
special exam on the cruise ship. After the sports festival, they were down to
874. Class B was closing in on them with 753 points. Plus, Class C was
sitting at 542 points. Class D had 262 points.
“I admit we’re in a bad situation. I didn’t understand how the school
was structured, and my inability to grasp the point system didn’t help,” he
Page 14
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
replied.
He was right. The point system was a problem. It appeared simple at
first, but there were strangely unclear layers to how it functioned. The school
was particularly tough on absences, tardiness, and poor class behavior; Class
D had been hit hard by that. In one month, our class lost all the points we’d
started out with. The memory still haunted me. Students now took class more
seriously, but I doubted the penalties were all completely gone.
“This is unlike any high school I ever imagined.” Katsuragi crossed his
arms, looking dissatisfied. “The school operates on a mysterious,
incomprehensible system. Students in the same grade should get along, not be
hostile toward each another.”
The school thrived on competition, without a doubt. The animosity
between classes could increase the cohesion within a class, but, well, only
Class B seemed peaceful right now. Several students in Class D chipped
away at our sense of unity, and Class C was a dictatorship. Then there was
Class A, currently divided between two factions locked in a power struggle.
“Aren’t you concerned, Ayanokouji?”
“Honestly, no. This school is fascinating. With a certain degree of hard
work, we don’t need to worry about necessities like food, clothing, and
shelter, and we can use our points to enjoy ourselves. The facilities provided
are all more than satisfactory, so I have no complaints,” I answered.
“I agree. If anything, the environment they provided us is too perfect. I
can’t imagine that it’s good to treat teenagers like this. Anyway, to return to
the point, please warn Horikita about Ryuuen.”
I promised I’d tell her. Ryuuen was certainly Class D’s enemy.
“Guess you just want to live in peace, too? Our problems never end,” I
muttered.

That night, Karuizawa called me while I hung out in my room. She
got right to the point. “I have something to ask you.”
“If I can answer it, then sure.”
“Satou-san confessed her feelings to you, didn’t she?”
That blindsided me. How did Karuizawa know?
“A lot of girls in class already know.”
“Good lord. Teenage girls are faster than the internet. Who’s your
source?” I asked.
“What do you mean, ‘who’? Satou-san herself. She told me in advance
that she was going to confess to you,” Karuizawa replied.
Was this like insider trading or something? “Is that why you looked
over at me this afternoon?”
“You noticed?”
“It shouldn’t matter who confesses to whom. Why pay attention to that
kind of thing?” I asked.
“Because that’s just how girls are.”
Was this kind of like wanting to write your name on your possessions?
Guys did similar things, if not in exactly the same ways. Even so, this didn’t
make sense.
“It’s not a competition,” I said. “Why do you care if someone makes a
declaration?”
“People will be super turned off if you suddenly proclaim that you’re
going out with someone. It’ll make you look really pathetic. Anyway, I don’t
care about that. It’s…whatever. What I want right now is your answer,” she
replied.
As if this wasn’t nerve-racking enough already. “My answer to her has
nothing to do with you.”
Page 16
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Well, I guess that’s true. But it’s not like it isn’t my business at all,
right? I mean, you threatened me. You made me do all kinds of things for
you. The girls’ information network is pretty wide, and I don’t want lots of
rumors floating around. Every time I get myself involved in something for
you, it puts me at risk. Understand?”
In other words, Karuizawa wanted to make sure I wouldn’t tell Satou
anything about her if Satou and I started dating. Or maybe she was afraid that
I’d stop protecting her if I only cared about Satou? It was clearly eating at
her, but I was still missing something. Karuizawa was a logical person, but
she was pushing too hard this time.
“Well, you don’t need to worry about it,” I said.
“Does that mean you’re thinking about going out with her?”
“I didn’t say that.”
“You are, though. You didn’t say that you were turning her down. Ew!
I can see right through you. You’re happy Satou confessed to you, because
now you’re just going to go dream up some naughty, perverted stuff. Guys
are so gross,” she said.
This was nuts. Karuizawa was like a parent raving about their kid
becoming an Olympic athlete one day just because they started crawling
early. “Well, even if guys are perverts, I don’t have any feelings for Satou,” I
replied.
“Okay then. Prove it. What’s your reason for refusing her?” she asked.
“Prove what? She didn’t even confess her feelings to me. She just said
she wanted to start out as friends, and we exchanged phone numbers.”
“I see. So, it was like that.”
Why did I have to talk to Karuizawa about this stuff? “I didn’t need to
respond to a confession. It just ended with us exchanging contact
information.”
“Hmm. Well, I suppose we can leave things at that for today,” she said.
Karuizawa was acting like a condescending spymaster. Since I had her
on the phone right now anyway, I decided to confirm something. “Manabe
and those other Class C girls haven’t tried anything with you since we were
on the cruise ship, have they?”
Page 17
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“No. It’s okay, at least for now.” Karuizawa’s voice got low. She
didn’t want to think about that incident.
“I’ve taken countermeasures, but in the event something does happen,
let me know right away. I’ll make sure it’s resolved,” I told her.
I heard Karuizawa hold her breath over the phone. Had I been too
bold?
“I see. I know that if I’m not useful to you, it’ll be bad for me,” she
replied.
To survive at this school, Karuizawa needed to keep her current social
standing. To do that, she had to conceal the truth of her past. Manabe and her
friends didn’t really know that truth. The problem was Ryuuen pulling the
strings from behind the scenes. I might have to confront him at some point,
and that time was most likely nigh.
“Anyway, back to our earlier topic. What do you plan to do about
Satou-san? Since you exchanged contact information, it’s possible things
could move to the next level, right?” asked Karuizawa.
“I’m putting things on hold. I mean, I don’t know Satou. She may not
even call.”
“So, if Satou-san pursues you or tries to cling to you, you’ll dump
her?”
“What do you mean, ‘dump’? All we did was exchange numbers. It’s
not like I’m going to go call her myself.” I didn’t have the guts to just ask
Satou out on a date, or to make a romantic confession.
“I suppose.” Karuizawa seemed mollified.
“Karuizawa.”
“What?”
“Make sure to erase records of our calls from your phone.”
“Yeah, I’ve already been doing that. Emails, too.”
“Just as expected.” Karuizawa knew how to handle herself.
“If that’s all, I’m going to hang up,” she said.
“Sure.” With that, the call ended.
Page 18
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
To be honest, I wanted to say one more thing, but decided not to.
Talking about what was to come would just put pressure on Karuizawa,
anyway.
I didn’t want to tell her about the potential danger we faced. Not yet.

Chapter 3:
The Paper Shuffle
 
A few days later, our class’s atmosphere was heavy. The feeling
wasn’t disappointment so much as nervousness. Class D’s homeroom
teacher, Chabashira-sensei, appeared to sense it.
“Take your seats. It seems you prepared quite a bit in advance for this,”
she remarked.
The moment Chabashira-sensei walked in, everyone went quiet and a
bit stiff. We should’ve behaved like that originally. It was the natural way for
a class to be, but Chabashira-sensei didn’t hide her surprise at our mature
conduct.
“My, my. You all look so serious. It’s hard to imagine you’re Class D.”
“It’s because today’s the day you announce the midterm results, right?”
Ike looked slightly nervous.
Chabashira-sensei grinned in response.
“That’s exactly right. The school will expel you immediately if you fail
the midterm or final exam. I told you as much before, so I imagine it’s fresh
in your memory. I’m happy to see that you’ve matured, but results are results.
If you received a failing grade, you’ll need to prepare for the consequences.
So, without further ado, I’ll now post the results. Read them carefully.”
Her warning was genuine. The classroom’s surveillance cameras
always had their lenses trained on the students, observing everything. If
someone acted out after seeing their test scores, the school would
undoubtedly respond with draconian measures.
“So, we can see everyone’s test scores?”
“Of course. It’s allowed by the school’s rules.”
There was absolutely no privacy, nothing concealed. Just like a
company might post up every salesman’s profits, our chart exposed the
capable and the incapable alike.
The threshold for failing hadn’t changed from the previous test, but the
Page 21
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
situation was a little different.
“A score of forty or higher is considered a passing grade for all
subjects. Anyone with a score under forty will face expulsion. These scores
also reflect your results from the sports festival. If anyone achieved a score of
over one hundred points on this test because of their sports festival results,
the school will treat them as having received a perfect score.”
Meanwhile, the school would deduct ten points from the midterm
scores of the ten students with the lowest sports festival results. Sotomura
was one of the worst-scoring students in the sports festival from any grade, so
he needed to score ten points higher in every subject to compensate.
Ike and Sudou wore stiff expressions. Many students waited with bated
breath as Chabashira-sensei slowly posted the scores on the blackboard.
However, Horikita didn’t seem nervous at all.
“Wh-what?! No way!”
The results started with those students who scored lowest and went up.
Many students naturally expected to see Sudou’s name at the bottom of the
list, because he’d scored lowest on the midterm and the final exam. However,
the first name to come up was “Haruki Yamauchi.” Next was “Ike Kanji.”
Following that came Inogashira, Satou, and Sotomura. Sotomura
always had middling scores, but I imagined that the penalties he’d incurred
from the sports festival resulted in him ranking this low.
“Oh no! Dude, did I seriously get the lowest score?!” wailed
Yamauchi.
Fortunately, he’d scored over forty points in every subject, his lowest
grade being a forty-three in English. He barely passed overall, with an
average just slightly below fifty points. Yamauchi probably felt as if his life
flashed before his eyes for a moment. He broke out in a cold sweat.
Sudou’s results were more surprising. Until today, he’d always ranked
at the very bottom of the class, but now he’d moved up significantly, going to
twelfth from the bottom. Even if you took away his sports festival points, his
results were still incredible. Everyone looked shocked; he had an average
score of fifty-seven points.
“I just obliterated a personal best! Dude, I almost got an average score
Page 22
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
of sixty!” Sudou shouted. He shot up and began literally dancing with joy.
“That’s not good enough to merit such a fuss,” said Horikita.
“Especially since your sports festival points helped.”
“Guh! Y-yeah…” Sudou sat back down, looking despondent at
Horikita’s rebuke. He was just like a faithful dog responding to his master’s
orders.
“Sudou got an average of fifty-seven points. Study group gets results,”
I remarked.
Even in his worst subject, English, Sudou had remarkably managed to
score fifty-two points. Apparently, Horikita had tutored Sudou and the other
failing students. I wasn’t invited to help tutor the group, but that was only
natural. From the others’ perspective, I wasn’t in the “smart people” category.
“The study group had an impact, yes. However, other significant
factors helped. Sudou was lucky that this midterm test was made up of
relatively simple problems,” Horikita said.
“That might be true.” This midterm had been, without a doubt, a bit
easier than usual. Some questions were so easy I thought the school might’ve
included them by mistake. That said, Sudou’s hard work definitely paid off.
Horikita tutored all her students equally, but Sudou had taken things a step
further, giving up his free days to study one-on-one with her. The power of
love really was a terrifying thing.
“You have an average of sixty-four points. That’s so mediocre. Why
don’t you stop fooling around and get serious?” Horikita asked me.
“That was the absolute best I could do.” I usually scored around fifty
points, so it’d attract attention if I suddenly got a perfect score. I thought it
would be best if I made slow but steady progress. That said, Sudou’s
breakthrough meant I could probably afford to increase my score a little
more.
“It’s so insipid that you’re still playing the clown. Honestly, I can’t
listen to you anymore.”
“I don’t think you’ve ever listened to me,” I replied.
“I suppose that’s true.”
At any rate, because the test problems had been simple, there were a
Page 23
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
few perfect scores among those students at the top of the class. Chabashira-
sensei even gave us a genuine compliment. “As you can see, no one has to
drop out of school due to their midterm scores this time. All of you managed
to pass.”
“Obviously. I’m looking forward to next month’s private points,
sensei!” said Sudou, his elbows propped up on his desk.
Chabashira-sensei responded with an unchanging smile. “That’s right.
It would be reasonable to expect a private point increase in November. I must
say, in the three years I’ve taught at this school, no other Class D has held on
this long without any students dropping out. Well done.”
Chabashira-sensei had never shown us this side of her personality until
today. Quite a few students seemed hesitant to believe that it was genuine.
“You praising us feels weird.” Horikita was hard to fool. Although it
was wonderful that no one had failed, she understood that Chabashira-sensei
wasn’t the type to end on a positive note. The gentler Chabashira-sensei
acted, the creepier we all felt.
Our teacher’s hair, tied up into a ponytail, swayed bewitchingly.
Chabashira-sensei slowly passed between the rows of desks, as if intending to
make a trip around the classroom. When she arrived at Ike’s desk, she
stopped.
“You managed to pass, but I want to ask you something. What do you
think of this school? I’d like to hear your honest evaluation.”
“Well, I guess…it’s a good school. If you do well, you can get tons of
spending money. The food’s tasty, and the rooms are nice and clean,” said
Ike. He counted on his fingers as he listed more things. “You can buy games
and stuff. Plus, there’re movies to see and karaoke. And the girls are cute.”
That last part wasn’t really the school’s doing, of course.
“Um…d-did I say something wrong?” asked Ike, looking fearfully at
Chabashira-sensei.
“No. From a student’s perspective, this is quite a paradise. Even as a
teacher, I feel that this school is almost excessively lavish. It treats the
students here so well that it almost defies common sense,” she replied.
Chabashira-sensei began to walk once more, heading for my side of the
Page 24
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
classroom. I had the feeling she was going to ask me a question in front of the
rest of the class. Don’t talk to me.
Fortunately, it seemed my request was heard, and Chabashira-sensei
stopped next to Hirata’s desk this time. “Hirata, do you like this school?” she
asked.
“Yes. I’ve made lots of friends, and I’m enjoying a fulfilling life.”
Hirata’s response was exemplary.
“Don’t you feel anxious, knowing that you could be expelled if you
happen to make a single mistake?”
“Whenever I’m nervous, I work harder with everyone else,” he replied.
Chabashira-sensei returned to the podium. It seemed as though she was
trying to confirm something, but I didn’t understand what. Maybe she wanted
a better sense of our class’s morale. Was she gauging our stamina, to see
whether we could handle what was to come?
“Next week, in preparation for the second semester’s final exam, there
will be a short test with problems from eight subjects. I’m sure that some of
you have already started studying, but I just wanted to remind you,” said
Chabashira-sensei.
“Geh! And I was just recovering from the midterm! Another test?!” Ike
wailed. Obviously, tests were an important part of student life, but in the
second semester the intervals between them were rather quick. “That means
there’s only a week left until the next short quiz! I haven’t heard about this at
all!”
Actually, the teachers constantly reminded us about the upcoming quiz.
Ike’s obliviousness made me want to sigh deeply.
“Saying that you haven’t heard about it won’t do. Don’t worry, though,
Ike.” Chabashira-sensei smiled as if she were throwing Ike a lifeline, but she
did nothing purely out of the kindness of her heart. We knew her better
than that.
Well, most of us did.
“Really, sensei? So, I can relax and take it easy? Woo!” shouted Ike.
Chabashira-sensei looked away from him. “There will be one hundred
questions on the test, making for a total of one hundred possible points.
Page 25
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
However, the questions will be on a third-year junior high school level. This
test is meant to confirm that you remember your fundamentals. Furthermore,
much like the mock test you took in the first semester, it won’t affect your
grades.”
“R-really? Good!”
“However—this test’s results will have an enormous impact on your
next final exam,” she added.
Of course. Nothing could be simple at this school. Our next challenge
was about to begin, it seemed.
“Wait, what kind of impact? Can you tell us?” Sudou asked. I
understood his frustration. Chabashira-sensei had purposefully drawn things
out to exacerbate the class’s anxieties.
“I would love to help you understand, Sudou. The school has decided
that this next quiz’s results will help determine which students to partner in
class,” said Chabashira-sensei.
“Partner?” Hirata sounded suspicious.
“That’s right. Pairs decided based on this test will go on to take the
final exam together. There will be eight subjects on that exam, each worth a
total of one hundred points. Four hundred test questions, fifty for each
subject. There are also two possible ways for you to fail that exam. If your
pair scores under sixty in even one subject, then the school will expel both
students. The sixty-point total, by the way, refers to the partners’ combined
score. For example, let’s say Ike and Hirata were partners. Even if Ike scored
zero points, they’d both be safe as long as Hirata scored sixty points.”
Everyone gasped. With an excellent partner, this would be an easy test.
However, this still left the second method of failing.
“There’s one additional hurdle to overcome. The school has decided
that you must secure a certain overall score to avoid failing. Even if you get
sixty points or more in each of the eight individual subjects, failing to meet
this overall score requirement will mean expulsion.”
“So, the overall requirement represents both partners’ combined
score?”
“Yes, exactly. The school hasn’t yet determined the exact score
Page 26
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
required, but in years past, it’s been around seven hundred points,” said
Chabashira-sensei.
Seven hundred points. With two people working together across eight
subjects—sixteen scores in total, two for each subject—you’d need a
minimum average of 43.75 points in every subject. Even excellent students
like Horikita or Yukimura could be at risk, depending on their partner.
“You mentioned that the overall required score is still unclear. Why?”
asked Hirata.
“Don’t be so hasty. I’ll explain the overall requirements in more detail
later. The final exam will be held over two days, with four subjects per day,
and I’ll let you know the subjects’ order. In the event that someone is absent
due to poor health, the school will investigate the absence’s legitimacy. If it’s
confirmed to be unavoidable, the student will receive points based on a rough
estimate of what they would’ve earned given past test results. However,
should the school find that an absent student didn’t have sufficient reason to
miss class, they will receive a score of zero points for all tests missed,”
Chabashira-sensei replied.
We couldn’t avoid taking this exam. The school was telling us that
caring for our health was another test of ability.
“At any rate, you’re starting to behave like proper students. If this
announcement were earlier in the year, you’d probably all be wailing by
now.”
“Well, we’ve gotten used to it,” Ike responded.
“Well said, Ike. Many of you probably think the same thing, which is
why I’m going to give you just one piece of advice. Don’t assume that you
understand how this school works just because you’ve finished the first
semester of your first year. In the future, you’ll face countless exams far more
difficult than those you face now,” Chabashira-sensei replied.
“P-please don’t say such terrifying things, sensei,” said one of the girls.
“Well, it’s the truth. In years past… We call it the ‘Paper Shuffle,’ but
one or two pairs are usually expelled due to this test. Most of them are from
Class D. This is by no means a threat; I’m just telling you the facts.”
The class’s optimism rapidly faded. But what did Chabashira-sensei
Page 27
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
mean by “Paper Shuffle,” exactly?
“The school will expel any failed partners without exception. If you
think this is a mere threat, then it might be good for you to talk to an
upperclassman. You should’ve started building connections with them, after
all,” said Chabashira-sensei. “Lastly, although this is obvious, cheating is
forbidden. Anyone who cheats will immediately be disqualified and expelled,
along with their partner. The same applies to all midterm and final
examinations.”
If this were an ordinary high school, the punishment for cheating
would probably be an automatic zero in all subjects, a stern warning, or
suspension at the very most. Chabashira-sensei was giving us ample warning
to prevent students from panicking and making mistakes. However, the pair
system was still a real problem.
“After I get the short test’s results, I’ll tell you how the all-too-
important partners will be decided,” Chabashira-sensei added.
I quietly picked up my pen. Horikita grabbed hers at almost the exact
same time and started writing something. Since she was taking notes, I put
my own pen down. If Horikita was on it, I was useless.
“If you get partnered with the student at the bottom, won’t you be in
deep trouble?” Sudou asked.
“Ugh! Ken’s humiliating me! I’m going to study hard and turn things
around!” Yamauchi cried.
“Don’t push yourself. You’re all talk. You haven’t seen anything yet;
I’ve been studying a lot,” said Sudou.
Yamauchi slumped, looking as though he were writhing in agony.
Sudou’s words weren’t empty; as long as Horikita kept helping him, he really
would work hard.
“One more aspect of this final exam will challenge you,” said
Chabashira-sensei.
While the rest of the class was slightly agitated by this, Horikita
appeared mildly exasperated. “So, there’s another thing we have to do?”
“Yes. First, the school will ask you to create your own questions to
appear on the final exam. They’ll use the questions you come up with for one
Page 28
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
of the other three classes. That means classes will be able to attack one
another, so to speak. The school will compare your class’s overall score to
the overall score for the class that received your test questions. The class that
scores higher will take points from the losing class. Fifty class points,
specifically,” said Chabashira-sensei.
To sum up, pairs needed to score above seven hundred points in
aggregate or be expelled. Meanwhile, we also needed to score sixty points or
higher for each individual subject or be expelled. Furthermore, our entire
class’s overall score had to exceed the overall score of the class whose test
questions we set.
“But let’s say Class A attacks Class B, and Class D attacks Class A,”
said Horikita. “If Class A successfully carries out their attack on Class B
while simultaneously defending against Class D, they’ll gain a total of one
hundred points. However, if Class A attacks Class D and Class D attacks
Class A, won’t things just cancel each other out?”
“In the event of a one-on-one confrontation of that kind, class scores
may go up or down by a hundred points at a time. Don’t worry. Although this
is unlikely, if the overall scores are tied, then the matchup will end in a draw,
and no class will lose or gain points,” said Chabashira-sensei.
“So, we have to come up with problems for the other classes to solve.
I’ve never heard of anything like this. How will this be executed? If someone
devises absurdly hard questions…”
“Yeah, yeah! That’s right! They could pick stuff we haven’t learned
yet! This is impossible!” Ike and some other students threw up their hands in
frustration.
“Teachers will evaluate the questions you create. If they exceed what
you have been taught, or cannot be answered with the information provided,
they will be revised. We’ll ensure that each class submits fair questions and
answers. Do you understand, Ike?” asked Chabashira-sensei.
“Uh, yeah, I guess,” he replied. It sounded deceptively easy, but
probably wasn’t that simple.
“Creating four hundred questions, huh? That’ll make for a pretty tight
schedule,” said Hirata.
We had about a month left until the test. A single person would have to
Page 29
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
come up with ten to fifteen questions per day to get them done in time.
Although we could put several people to work devising questions, that would
cause some variation in quality. If we had to make any revisions after
submitting the problems to the school, we’d need to work quickly. If you also
took Class D’s flaws into account, finishing the questions would come down
to the wire. Hirata must have understood that, because he looked flustered.
“If you don’t complete the questions in time, certain measures are in
place to help you. After the submission deadline passes, the school will
utilize its own premade questions. However, please keep in mind that those
questions will be easier,” said Chabashira-sensei.
Only a mixed blessing, then. We had to create our own questions, no
matter what, which meant someone would have to do the lion’s share of that
work in addition to managing their own studies. This test would be brutal.
“You may consult teachers and students from other classes, and you
can use the internet. There are few restrictions. As long as the school accepts
the questions, we don’t care about much else,” said Chabashira-sensei.
“So, our final test will obviously include questions from another class,
right?”
“Exactly. Each class will choose another class to compete against, and
I will report that request to my superiors. If another class makes the same
choice, representatives will draw lots. However, if there are no duplicate
nominations, your choice of class will be honored. I’ll accept your
nomination for the class you’d like to go up against next week, the day before
the short test. You should think very carefully,” she added.
The final exam was us against the school—but this time, it was a street
fight. Who we’d be paired with was the least of our worries right now.
“That’s all for the preliminary explanation. The rest is up to you,” said
Chabashira-sensei.
With that, our classes ended for the day.

“We’re holding a meeting, Ayanokouji-kun. Can you get Hirata-
kun for me?” Horikita asked.
“Roger.”
I went to talk to Hirata, and Horikita walked over to Sudou. Horikita
and Hirata were gradually becoming the class’s prime movers and shakers. I
couldn’t stay in the shadows much longer. So far, I’d kept up the pretense of
not being the sharpest tool in the shed. However, after running that relay race,
I became well-known practically overnight. Ryuuen and Ichinose wanted the
identity of the person pulling Horikita’s strings, without a doubt.
What should I do about that? Distance myself from Horikita? That
would look suspicious, though. Should I stick close to her and wait for things
to pass? I’d be under suspicion so long as I remained around her, too.
Our list of enemies was growing. I’d been able to hang out with
Horikita as much as I did because she’d had very few friends, but things were
changing. Maybe I’d put some distance between her and myself, then. I
needed to keep Chabashira-sensei happy, and if Horikita and the others could
handle the class without me, it would take a load off my shoulders.
Chabashira-sensei probably didn’t need me, specifically, to help Class D.
Anyone would do. As for why she wanted to threaten me into helping Class
D rise to Class A, well, I didn’t really care.
At any rate, it wasn’t time for me to release Horikita just yet. If I let go
right here and now, I’d lose control of Class D, and everything might
collapse. First, I’d make Horikita even more influential. Then, I’d quietly
fade away.
I returned to Horikita. “Hirata’s on his way. Same with Sudou.” I’d
seen him duck out, probably to go to the bathroom.
“So, what do you think?” Horikita cut to the chase.
“It’s just like Chabashira-sensei said. This exam will be difficult. The
bar is high, and the partner system makes it worse. To top it off, if another
class comes up with the problems we have to solve, the test could get
Page 31
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
extremely tough. Depending on how the question’s worded, even something
straightforward could appear unsolvable.”
“That’s true. This time, it’s not just about studying. We have to be
creative,” said Horikita.
Simply tutoring the weaker students among us wouldn’t be enough.
Understanding the other classes’ strengths and weaknesses would be ideal,
but they wouldn’t show us their hands easily. Still, we’d overcome trials
based on intelligence and teamwork before.
In a sense, this test might be less difficult than the ones on the island or
the cruise ship. If the sports festival had tested our class’s accumulated
physical strength, this was a test of accumulated academic knowledge.
“I feel as if Chabashira-sensei was hinting at something,” I told
Horikita.
“Yes. I noticed,” she replied quietly. “The school packs hints into
everything. The three key points Chabashira-sensei made were that the short
test won’t affect our grades, that the criteria for the combined scores hadn’t
been decided yet, and that they’d determine our partners after the short test.”
I instinctively smiled in response to Horikita’s perfect, concise
breakdown. Not long afterward, Hirata joined us.
“Sorry to have kept you waiting. You wanted to discuss plans, right?”
Hirata called to Karuizawa to join us. Though she glared at us as if it was a
huge bother, she came.
“Sorry. I thought that we should talk things over right away,” Horikita
said. A few months ago, it would’ve been shocking for her to initiate a
meeting like this. Now, though, she was the class’s commander. “I’d like to
start right away.”
“Huh? Wait, right here? No way. If we’re talking things over, we
might as well go to Pallet. Right, Yousuke-kun?” asked Karuizawa.
Karuizawa tightly hugged Hirata’s arm, snuggling close to him. It was
her usual method of getting what she wanted. Pallet was a café on school
grounds, one that mostly catered to girls. During lunch breaks and after class,
it often overflowed with people.
My eyes met Karuizawa’s for an instant. Though I didn’t know why,
Page 32
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
she quickly let go of Hirata’s arm.
“We don’t know where the enemy might be watching us from, but…
Well, it’s fine, I suppose,” replied Horikita. She probably understood that it
would be unwise to antagonize Karuizawa right now. She might not have
been consciously aware of it, but Horikita was definitely maturing.
“Excuse me, but would it be all right if I joined you, too?” Kushida
Kikyou asked. “Is that okay…?”
“I’m fine with you joining us. You understand our class very well,
Kushida-san. Besides, I’d like to hear several people’s opinions,” I said.
“Of course, Kushida-san. I planned on inviting you, anyway,” said
Horikita. That was a surprising move. “Could you three head over to Pallet
first? I have a few things to take care of.”
Kushida, Karuizawa, and Hirata agreed and left without any particular
objections. I turned to Horikita.
“Is that really okay? Bringing Kushida in?”
Kushida Kikyou was a valuable asset, but she also hated Horikita. I
couldn’t say for certain that she wouldn’t try to sabotage us. Furthermore,
during the sports festival, Kushida’s betrayal put Class D in a tight spot.
“Wouldn’t it seem weird to refuse her?” Horikita replied.
“Sorry to make you wait, Suzune,” said Sudou, coming up to us.
“It’s all right. Hirata-kun and the others are meeting us at Pallet,
anyway.”
“Okay, sure. Hey, uh, sorry about this…but, um, would it be okay if I
peeked in on my club? The upperclassmen asked for me to be there. It should
be over in, like, twenty or thirty minutes,” said Sudou.
“I don’t mind. Come join us as soon as you finish,” replied Horikita.
Sudou flashed a smile, grabbed his bag, and hurried out of the
classroom. Horikita picked up her own bag and headed to the door.
“I think I’m gonna head back to my dorm. Give it your best,” I told
her.
“Wait a minute. You were invited, too. You’re absolutely
indispensable as the intermediary between Hirata-kun and Karuizawa-san. I
Page 33
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
still can’t control either of them,” said Horikita.
“You say that, but I think you’re a capable leader. Besides, the final
exam will test everything we’ve learned. You and your study group handled
the midterm without my help.”
“That might be true. But if Kushida-san is in the group, it’s a different
story. Can you at least participate in today’s discussion? Or don’t you want
the truth about Kushida?” asked Horikita.
“If I said I wasn’t interested, I’d be lying.” Kushida showed no
favoritism toward anyone, and treated everybody in class equally, so I wanted
to know why she held such animosity for Horikita alone.
“I’ll tell you everything I know about her,” said Horikita. “Honestly, I
don’t want to go around spreading rumors, but I think informing you is
necessary.”
“I wonder why you’re so interested in talking to me about Kushida.”
“What do you mean?”
“Well, you kept quiet about her until now. When did you two start
fighting?”
Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed that Horikita went quite stiff. “I
can’t talk to you about it here. Understand?”
Even the walls had ears, after all. “I understand. I suppose I’ll come
along with you.”
I imagined that the story was worth going to a meeting.
Out in the hallway, Horikita spoke to me in a hushed whisper. “Where
would you like me to start?” she asked.
“From the beginning. All I know is that you two aren’t on good terms.”
I wanted more information on Kushida’s dark side, but I didn’t dare bring it
up. I wasn’t sure how much Horikita was aware of.
“I really don’t know much at all about Kushida Kikyou. When did you
first meet her?” Horikita asked.
I answered honestly. “On the bus.”
“I see. I also saw Kushida-san on the bus on the first day of school,”
she replied.
Page 34
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
I remembered that an elderly woman on the bus had been forced to
stand because there weren’t any open seats. Kushida had asked if someone
would give the old lady a seat, a good deed in and of itself, a faultless act of
kindness. However, no one gave theirs up right away. As one of those who
hadn’t offered, the scene had left a deep impression on me.
“You think Kushida started hating you back then? Kouenji also refused
to give up his seat. I didn’t give mine up, either,” I told her. “But you’re the
only one she hates.”
“I didn’t know Kushida-san back then. Well, to be more accurate, I
didn’t remember her,” said Horikita.
“So, you knew each other before you met at this school?”
“Yes. We attended the same junior high, but it was in a completely
different prefecture. Even in her wildest dreams, she probably never imagined
that someone from her junior high would end up here too,” Horikita said.
“I see.” Horikita had solved one great mystery.
“I remembered her after the first-semester study group. My junior high
was an enormous school with over a thousand students. I was never in the
same class as Kushida-san,” said Horikita. “I didn’t know her.”
That wasn’t really a surprise, if I assumed that Horikita had been as
solitary back in junior high as she was now. She’d probably immersed herself
in studying.
Horikita and I didn’t head straight for Pallet. Instead, we spent time
wandering around school, taking a detour. The farther away from the café we
went, the fewer people were around.
“What was Kushida like in junior high?”
“No idea. Like I said, I didn’t interact with her. However, she was
incredibly popular. Looking back, I remember classmates rallying around her
during all kinds of events. She was nice to everyone, sociable, and well liked.
She had the same level of influence as the student council,” said Horikita.
“I don’t think she hates you just because she couldn’t befriend you,” I
said.
“You’re right. The crucial part comes next. However, please keep in
mind that this is nothing more than a rumor. Only Kushida-san herself knows
Page 35
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
the full truth.” With that preface out of the way, Horikita continued. “In
February of our third year, just as graduation approached, one entire class fell
apart.”
“Fell apart? What, like they all got sick?”
“No. Apparently, a certain female student triggered an incident that
destroyed her class. They didn’t recover until graduation,” said Horikita.
“I don’t even need to ask who that girl was, do I?”
“It was Kushida-san. But I don’t know the details. The school
completely buried the incident. If it became public knowledge, their
credibility would take a hit. It would even affect graduates who wanted to
advance to higher education or find a job. Still, the school couldn’t suppress
everything. Rumors started to spread,” said Horikita.
“Do you know anything, even if it’s just a fragment of a rumor?” I
asked.
“Some students said that the classroom was in complete disarray right
after the incident. The blackboard and desks were covered with all kinds of
slanderous scribblings.”
“Covered with slander, huh? Is it possible Kushida was bullied, then?”
“I don’t know. So many rumors floated around. Someone was being
bullied, or they were doing the bullying. I even heard rumors about violence,
though the details were vague. But then the rumors stopped in the blink of an
eye. No one wanted to talk about it. Even though a whole class nearly fell
apart, people suddenly acted as if nothing had happened.”
“Still, it’s not like it’s your fault that Kushida made that class fall apart.
I’m sure you weren’t paying attention to what happened, anyway.”
“You’re exactly right. I knew I wanted to come to this school, so I was
utterly focused on preparing. I didn’t care that much about anything else,”
Horikita replied.
I couldn’t imagine the Kushida I knew doing any of that. However, if
this were true, then I understood why she couldn’t allow anyone who knew
the truth about her to stick around. If people found out, Kushida would lose
all the social capital she’d gained.
“So, Kushida did something bad, but you don’t know the specific
Page 36
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
details. However, she doesn’t seem to know that you don’t know. She
believes that, because you attended the same junior high, you know
everything that happened.”
“She isn’t exactly wrong. I do know that she caused the incident.”
Horikita sighed.
The tension between them was all thanks to Kushida’s one-sided
misunderstanding and hostility. Kushida would do anything to keep her past
hidden. Even if Horikita said that she knew nothing about the incident,
Kushida wouldn’t believe her. If Kushida knew what we were currently
discussing, she would’ve taken it as proof that Horikita knew about her past.
“I still don’t understand,” Horikita said.
“About the incident?”
“Yeah. It’s just all so weirdly mysterious. How does a class with no
problems collapse all of a sudden?” She shook her head.
“It’s possible that Kushida triggered it, but how could one single
student have that much power?” I replied. This didn’t come down to simple
bullying. If that were the case, only a few people would’ve been involved.
“Honestly, I can’t imagine,” said Horikita.
Even if I’d wanted Class D to fall apart, I couldn’t cause it just like
that. “You’d need a powerful weapon,” I said.
“If you wanted to destroy our class, what would you do?”
“To answer your question with another question, what’s the deadliest
weapon in the world? What can Kushida manipulate? Think about it,” I said.
“As I’ve said before, violence is the deadliest weapon a human being
can wield. It has rather unique power. No matter how clever the scholar or
how influential the politician, no one is physically invulnerable,” said
Horikita.
“You’re not wrong. Violence is one of the deadliest weapons.
However, Kushida didn’t use violence to corner everyone. If that were true,
you’d have heard.” If Kushida had gone on a rampage with a chainsaw, the
media would’ve had a field day. “What about something that can compete
with violence’s unique power?”
Page 37
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Do you have something in mind?” asked Horikita.
“Let’s say that I was the one setting out to destroy our class. In that
case, I can think of something I’d use. Can you?”
“Wait.” Horikita gave it some thought. “I want to say ‘authority,’ but
how many students have authority like that?”
“Authority is a powerful weapon, but even the student council
president couldn’t create that much mayhem. There’s no way someone like
Kushida could reduce a class to nothing through authority.”
“Then what is it? What can bring an entire class to its knees?”
“Forget Kushida for a moment. What powerful weapon is available to
anyone? Lies. People are natural liars by birth. Anyone can lie. Depending on
the time and the place, a lie can do more damage than simple violence.”
Statistics show that people lie two or three times a day, on average.
You might think that seems impossible, but the definition of a “lie” is rather
broad. “I didn’t get enough sleep,” “I caught a cold,” “I didn’t notice that
email,” “I’m fine.” Everything we say is full of lies.
“Lies. I see. You might be right.”
Lies were incredibly powerful. A single lie could even drive someone
to their death. “I’ll cut right to the chase. If you used violence and lies, could
you cause Class D to fall apart? Think about it.”
“I can’t say for sure. Hypothetically speaking, I couldn’t overcome
some people in our class with violence. I can’t imagine defeating Sudou-kun
or Kouenji-kun with my bare hands. Besides, there are also people like you
whose strengths I don’t fully know,” said Horikita.
“Right. Anyone can use violence, but not everyone can use it
effectively,” I told her.
“I can’t see Kushida-san using much violence. So, if the options are
violence or lies, it’s only natural to conclude that she lied to destroy her
class,” said Horikita.
“Yes.”
“But…could she really do that?”
“Dunno. For her, it might not be impossible,” I said. Still, bringing
Page 38
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
down an entire class was an extensive undertaking. “Can Kushida really
command such power? Or maybe…”
Maybe Kushida had a secret third weapon? Regardless, she’d certainly
been the culprit. If she wasn’t the one who destroyed her class, she wouldn’t
be this hostile toward Horikita.
“Kushida-san told me that she’d use any means necessary to get rid of
anyone who knew about her past. That she’d even work with Katsuragi-kun,
Sakayanagi-san, or Ichinose-san to drive me out. She’s already formed an
alliance with Ryuuen-kun to entrap me. She won’t stop as long as I’m here,
even if Class D suffers,” said Horikita.
“So, she’s prepared to destroy our class to hide her past.”
“I have no doubt.”
That couldn’t be an idle threat. Yet, even though Kushida had declared
war, she’d wanted to work with Horikita and Hirata today. Maybe that choice
was designed to maintain her position in class, but it was likely a hostile act.
She was probably trying to gather information.
Still, even if she was a spy, we needed Kushida. She’d built up
significant goodwill in Class D. If we started treating her like an outsider, the
other students wouldn’t trust us.
“How do you plan to deal with Kushida, Horikita?” I asked.
“My options are limited. I can tell her that I don’t know any details
about the incident, or that I won’t say anything to anyone, and hope I’ll
convince her.”
“It probably won’t be that simple. Kushida will remain suspicious, and
she likely won’t forgive you for even knowing about her past.” Horikita had
turned to me for help, which Kushida probably anticipated. It wasn’t
surprising that Kushida included me on the list of people she wanted to have
expelled.
“I still think my best option is to talk to her. Am I wrong?” asked
Horikita.
“No, I agree with you. Trying to convince her is probably the only
solution.” For now. Eventually, Kushida would push back in a big way. “I
might be jumping too far ahead, but if we’re going to reach Class A, we
Page 39
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
might need to give up on Kushida.”
Horikita glared at me. “You mean we should get Kushida-san
expelled?”
I nodded quietly. Strike your enemy down first; that was basic strategy.
However, Horikita looked disgusted.
“I didn’t think you’d propose something like that. When I decided to
let Sudou-kun fail months ago, you were the one who convinced me to help
him instead. And I understood. We couldn’t turn our backs on a person with
something to offer. To tell you the truth, if I’d abandoned Sudou-kun back
then, the sports festival probably would’ve ended even more disastrously.
And you saw how much he improved on the midterm. Am I wrong?”
The once-solitary Horikita had changed greatly. I was surprised to see
such a radical transformation in her. Still, her plan wasn’t realistic. She’d
done a good job of getting Sudou on our side, but I doubted that Horikita,
who wasn’t silver-tongued to begin with, could successfully win Kushida
over.
“This is different from just tutoring someone. To be honest, I don’t
think Kushida’s feelings are solely what drive her. This is more than just a
simple lack of understanding on her part. As long as you’re at this school,
Kushida will attempt to sabotage you, and Class D may pay the price. Are
you sure you won’t regret letting her stay?” I asked.
Horikita didn’t look swayed. On the contrary, she appeared more
determined than before. “She’s an excellent student. Not only can she win
people’s hearts and minds, she’s also a keen observer. If we make her our
ally, she’ll be a great asset.”
True enough, but could it even be done?
“This is my responsibility. I can’t just abandon her. I’m sure she’ll
understand,” said Horikita.
“If that’s what you want, then all right. I’ll keep watch.” I wanted to
believe it might work out. I wanted to see whether Horikita could really
befriend Kushida, just as she’d turned Sudou into someone she could trust.
“I didn’t say I wanted your help,” said Horikita.
“Yeah, you’re right. This has nothing to do with me,” I responded.
Page 40
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
We’d almost completed a lap around the campus. We would arrive at Pallet
shortly.
“I told you about Kushida-san because I thought that you’d keep it
secret, and that you’d understand,” said Horikita.
“Sorry I didn’t give you the answer you wanted.”
“Since I provided all this information, would you answer a question?”
she asked.
“What is it?”
Horikita stopped dead in her tracks and looked up at me. “What did
you do to Ryuuen-kun at the sports festival?”
“What did I do? I compromised, that’s it. All I did was ensure that
Ryuuen’s plans were crushed,” I told her.
“You mean, you recorded the conversation Ryuuen-kun had with the
Class C students? When he discussed his strategy?”
I nodded.
“It can’t have been easy to get that recording. How did you do it?
Ryuuen-kun said there was a spy, but you’re not friends with anyone from
Class C, are you?”
“I have my ways. I used what I had at my disposal.” Of course,
Horikita didn’t know about the trouble Manabe and her friends had caused
Karuizawa back on the cruise ship.
“Another thing. I was angry that you came to my rescue like that,
because it meant that you thought I would fail. But I suppose I was about to
fail, so…I can’t argue with you. Since you forbade me from prying into your
affairs, I can’t demand that you tell me more. Though it was troubling, it…
Well, if you hadn’t done anything, I would’ve… Well, thank you,” said
Horikita.
“That was an amazingly roundabout way of thanking me.”
“Are you sure you’re okay with being this conspicuous? Ryuuen-kun is
now convinced that someone in Class D is working behind the scenes, and
you’re probably on his list, Ayanokouji-kun. I think the peaceful life you
wanted is in jeopardy,” said Horikita.
Page 41
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
True, my high school life was becoming more stressful than I ever
wished it to be. But peace might never have been an option. Chabashira-
sensei had already mentioned a certain man who wanted to see me. Then
there was Sakayanagi, who knew my past.
“Good point. We’ll have to be especially cautious.”
“I’m starting to understand you less and less,” said Horikita.
“You never understood me at all.”
“I suppose that’s true.”
At any rate, Horikita didn’t have time to focus on Ryuuen or me. If she
didn’t deal with Kushida, her days at this school might be numbered.

As soon as we entered Pallet, Karuizawa glared at Horikita. “Jeez,
what were you even doing?! You’re so late! At least apologize.”
“Let’s get started. After all, Hirata-kun has club activities, right?” said
Horikita.
“Wow, you just ignored me. Typical,” said Karuizawa.
Besides Horikita and myself, the group now consisted of Hirata,
Karuizawa, Kushida, and Sudou. Horikita was right that there wasn’t much of
a grace period before club activities. It was already 3:50 in the afternoon, and
clubs convened at 4:30. Hirata, who was in the soccer club, should have been
the most anxious, but he remained calm and collected. Maybe he was
sincerely looking forward to this meeting, since his eyes shone.
After Horikita took her seat, she immediately launched into the
conversation. “Let’s discuss the upcoming short test, shall we?”
“Is it really that important? I mean, the school pretty much guaranteed
that our grades won’t reflect our test results,” said Karuizawa.
“I wasn’t going to force people to study. However, the school isn’t
making us take this test simply to measure our academic ability. We just
passed the midterm, after all.”
“We all passed because the midterm had easy questions, right?”
“So, there’s some special significance to the short test? Does the school
want to measure something other than our academics?” asked Hirata-kun.
“Huh? What? What are you talking about?” asked Karuizawa, perking
up considerably as Hirata spoke.
“The short test’s results will influence partner selection for the final
exam. That’s why it matters,” explained Horikita. Sudou looked somber. “Do
you understand, Sudou?”
“Just barely.” Sudou’s grasp on the current situation appeared dubious
at best.
Page 43
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“There must be some kind of process to select the pairs,” Horikita
continued. “If we discover that process, we can gain a clear advantage in the
final.”
“What’s that mean, Ayanokouji?” Sudou whispered. He most likely
didn’t want to interrupt Horikita’s explanation.
“It means that controlling the short test’s outcome is necessary to clear
the final exam,” I answered.
“Yeah, that’s what I thought.” Sudou’s lie was so incredibly obvious.
“So what? Will they match up the people who scored closest together
or something?” said Karuizawa.
“Or maybe they’ll pair someone who got an answer right with someone
who got the same answer wrong?” asked Sudou.
“Either is possible,” said Horikita.
Hirata seemed to have some doubts, since his expression turned
serious. “I’m a little skeptical about this.”
“About what? Please, I’d like to hear it,” said Horikita.
“If there is some kind of partner selection method, then I think we
should confirm it with an upperclassman,” Hirata said. “If it’s the same test
from previous years, then the rules probably haven’t changed. Maybe the
teachers would deliberately try to hide that?”
Kushida had listened quietly up to this point. After Hirata’s comment,
she spoke. “I was a little curious, too. I think an upperclassman I’m close
with might be willing to tell me.”
“Wow, just as expected, Yousuke-kun! You’re right!” Karuizawa
showered Hirata with admiration.
Horikita side-eyed her. “As Hirata-kun said, it’s certainly true that we
don’t know the facts. However, the school hasn’t tried to stop us from finding
out what the rules are. In fact, discovering them might be one of the test’s
prerequisites.”
“What do you mean, Suzune? Can you explain it like we’re dumb?”
asked Sudou. He looked as if he’d racked his brain so intensely that smoke
was about to shoot out of his ears.
Page 44
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“So, the test begins once we find out the rules? In that case, not
learning what they are could be disastrous,” said Hirata. He was probably
imagining a scenario in which the school expelled half the class.
“This is all just hypothetical, but if we don’t discover the process
behind the pairing, the results could be devastating. Chabashira-sensei said
this is the first time that Class D has made it this far without anyone being
expelled. She also said that, in previous years, only one or two pairs were
typically expelled, right? Isn’t that strange?” asked Horikita.
“Nope,” said Sudou. He banged his forehead against the table in
resignation.
“I see what you mean,” Hirata said. “Horikita-san is trying to say that,
if we understand how this all works, we might not suffer any serious harm.
Right?”
“Correct.”
“Why do you say that?” asked Karuizawa.
“Because we’re taking the final exam in pairs.”
“Yeah,” added Hirata. “If two failing students were paired up, it’d be
pretty bad.”
“Again, Chabashira-sensei said that only one or two pairs were
expelled in past years. That’s far too few, isn’t it? If the school partnered our
class’s weaker students together, it’d probably force close to ten people to
drop out,” said Horikita.
“Yousuke-kun, what does this mean?” asked Karuizawa. “I’m getting a
little confused.”
“Forget trying to figure out the rules for a moment. Imagine if we took
the exam without knowing that these rules even existed. What do you think
would happen?” asked Hirata.
“Umm, it’d be bad? If the dumber students got paired, we’d probably
see the school expel a lot of people,” said Karuizawa.
“Yeah, I think so, too. But, in past years, only one or two pairs from
Class D were expelled.”
“Isn’t that kinda weird?” Sudou seemed to realize what we were
Page 45
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
saying.
“The pairs seem balanced,” Hirata said.
Indeed. That seemed to be the trick.
“The pairs are made up of a high-scoring student and a low-scoring
student,” said Horikita. “It can’t be any other way. So, if I scored a hundred
points, and Sudou-kun scored zero points, we’d be the pair with the most
significant difference between our scores. That means we’d produce balanced
results on the test, because our scores would even out.”
Karuizawa seemed basically convinced. “I see. But doesn’t that mean
the average students are the most at risk?”
“Yes. The more average someone’s grades are, the greater the danger,”
said Horikita. “We need to confirm this with upperclassmen. Then we can
plan our next steps. Hirata-kun, Kushida-san, would you please talk to some
senior students?”
“Of course,” said Kushida.
“I’ll check with the upperclassmen in my soccer club,” said Hirata.
“I’d also like to ask one more thing,” said Karuizawa.
“Go ahead.”
“They said we’re being paired up, but what if there’s an odd number of
students?”
“I doubt we need to worry about that right now. At the time of
enrollment, all classes from A to D had an even number of students. No one’s
been expelled yet, so our class sizes haven’t changed. However…if someone
were expelled, it might place their class as a whole in an excruciating
situation.”
“Really? Wouldn’t it suck to suffer just because one person was
absent?” Apparently, Kushida thought that the school should be gentler.
“We started the year with an even number of students. If someone is
expelled or withdraws due to unforeseen circumstances, their class will have
to bear the consequences,” said Horikita.
During the test on the island and the sports festival, the school imposed
merciless penalties on nonparticipants. Horikita might’ve been right that, if
Page 46
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
even one student were kicked out, we’d likely suffer serious disadvantages in
future exams. She was probably realizing just how important it had been to
save Sudou.
“Do you understand?” Horikita asked.
“Yeah, I guess so. I just feel like thinking about it is a waste of time,”
said Karuizawa.
“Now that we’ve discussed the short test’s importance, we can move
on. But there’s one more thing. Which class do we nominate as our
opponent? In my mind, we should be going after Class C,” said Horikita.
“Their collective academic ability is their big weakness. Class C is inferior to
Classes A and B in academics. Looking at the class points so far, that’s plain
to see.”
She wasn’t wrong. Deliberately challenging an academically superior
class would be nearly suicidal.
However, Hirata offered his own two cents. “I agree, Horikita-san. But
Classes A and B will naturally think the same way. If Class C is so inferior
when it comes to academics, then multiple classes will likely go after them.
That might be bad news for us.”
Hirata wrote down the imaginary situation in his notebook.
 
Class A nominates Class D à No conflicts with other classes à Class D
is the target
Class B nominates Class C à Wins the lottery à Class C is the target
Class C nominates Class B à No conflicts with other classes à Class B
is the target
Class D nominates Class C à Loses the lottery à Class A becomes the
target by default
 
“Although this is a worst-case scenario, it could happen,” said Hirata.
“Whoa, that’d be awful. We’d have to solve problems the smart kids
made, and we’d have to make problems for them to solve, right? There’s no
way we could win,” said Karuizawa.
Page 47
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Yes, you’re right, the other classes will probably target Class C. But
there’s no reason we shouldn’t pick Class C too, don’t you think? We have to
do anything we can to try to win.” Horikita didn’t care that we might lose
the lottery.
“There’s a clear academic gap between Classes A and B, isn’t there?
I’m curious how different we are from Class C,” I said.
“There’s no doubt Class A is better academically. But I don’t think the
difference is that extreme. There does seem to be quite a stark difference
between B and C, I think. Hmm, I’ll have to investigate this,” said Horikita.
Truthfully, we didn’t know too much about the other classes. We only
knew the difference in points, and based solely on that, we couldn’t gauge
how smart each class was. Maybe that was the reason for these tests.
Still, I shifted my attention to Sudou.
Horikita did the same. “You’re awfully quiet, Sudou-kun. Usually,
you’d be complaining by now.”
“I just don’t get this conversation. Besides, if I started complainin’, it’d
disturb you,” he replied.
We all fell silent.
“What? Did I say somethin’ weird?” asked Sudou.
“No, it’s just…what you said was so observant and restrained, I was
surprised.”
“Well, we just gotta defeat our opponents one-on-one, right? We can’t
immediately jump up to Class A in one shot. So, attacking the class we’re
closest to—C—makes the most sense,” said Sudou.
“I see what you mean,” said Horikita. “If our combined score wins
against theirs, then the point gap between their class and ours will go down
dramatically.”
“Okay, but wouldn’t it be a good thing if Class A attacked C? I mean,
Class A would have no problem beating them. Then Class C would definitely
lose points. Wouldn’t that be good for us?”
“That depends.”
If the goal was to reduce Class C’s points, then it might be better for us
Page 48
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
to let Class A or B attack them. However, Class D also wanted to gain points.
To increase the chances of that happening, it would be better to compete
against a weaker opponent. Avoiding Class C would mean having to defeat a
stronger enemy.
“It seems like everyone agrees with Horikita-san’s plan. So, I’ll go
along with it, too,” said Hirata.
“Thank you. I think we can move on to the next stage.”
We disbanded a little after 4 p.m. Hirata and Sudou both left for their
respective clubs. Karuizawa followed Hirata.
“Well, I’ll go ask the senior students about the exam and report back,”
Kushida said as she left.
“We’re counting on you.” Horikita turned to me. “What are you
planning to do, Ayanokouji-kun?”
“Nothing. It should be fine if I leave the plans to you and Hirata, right?
Honestly, you’ve handled everything so far almost perfectly.”
“So far. But to ace the final exam, we need to be able to tackle it head
on,” said Horikita.
“Yeah. If Class D doesn’t study and improve, we’ll get nowhere. If
necessary, I can adjust my score in order to team up with a specific person,” I
said.
“So, I can count on you?”
“If it’s within my power, sure. I can join your study meetings if
needed. But I won’t be a leader.”
“Because you plan to act the mediocre student as long as possible,
right?”
“I prefer doing whatever is the least hassle.” I thought it was a fair
compromise.
However, Horikita was the furthest thing from undemanding. “Let me
think about it. You’re a member of Class D, after all, and I’d like to give you
an appropriate role. I want us to win,” she said.
“I’ll consider it.”

Chapter 4:
Class C Makes Its Move
 
Meanwhile, in a different classroom, the atmosphere was quite cold
and strained. The assembled Class C students appeared greatly intimidated by
the person standing at the podium before them.
“There’ve been many unnatural goings-on, wouldn’t you say?” he
asked.
Ryuuen Kakeru was Class C’s leader and dictator. Yamada Albert,
Ishizaki, and other students adept in martial arts stood next to him. They were
willing to dispense punishment with their fists, should someone oppose
Ryuuen.
“First there was that test on the uninhabited island, and then the sports
festival. Someone lurking in Class D knows how to think like me.”
“Someone thinks like you, Ryuuen-san? I can’t imagine someone like
that in Class D, though,” said Ishizaki. To him, Ryuuen was a strange,
incomprehensible being who commanded both respect and contempt.
Ryuuen smiled at Ishizaki. “I thought so, too. But not anymore.”
“So, are the events on the island and at the sports festival connected
somehow?”
“Yes, exactly. But don’t worry. I’m starting to see how this person
handles things. Listen up, all of you! From here on out, we’re going to hit
Class D with everything we’ve got. We’ll put Classes A and B aside for the
time being. I’ll smoke out the person working in Class D’s shadows,” said
Ryuuen.
Page 51
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Page 52
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
No one objected to his plan. Even if they wanted to, they couldn’t.
They’d already made a deal with the devil himself.
“Ryuuen-san, is there really anyone competent in Class D, besides
Horikita or Hirata?”
“Yes. And someone in Class C can expose the puppet master’s true
identity.”
“What are you trying to say, Ryuuen?” asked Ibuki, crossing her arms.
She stood near the window, her posture defiant.
“Heh. Ibuki, can’t you even listen quietly?” asked Ryuuen.
“I don’t have that luxury. Besides, you’re just trying to intimidate the
entire class. I gain nothing from silence, right?”
“You know, someone with no authority shouldn’t be talking. Besides,
you made a rather disgraceful blunder, didn’t you?” said Ryuuen.
“That’s…”
Ibuki’s failure in the sports festival had been significant. She’d
requested to challenge Horikita directly, but been narrowly defeated.
“Like you, then?” said Ibuki, glaring at Ryuuen. “I mean, you also
failed to crush Horikita in the sports festival, or to get the private points you
expected. You’re the same as me.”
“The same as you? Don’t make me laugh. My strategy was perfect,”
said Ryuuen.
“So, how do you explain the results? You never explain anything. You
seriously expect to convince us that Class D has some master strategist?” said
Ibuki.
Hearing Ibuki’s comeback, the other students trembled in fear. They
wanted to avoid incurring Ryuuen’s wrath.
However, Ryuuen only smiled thinly. “Don’t you think that a perfect
strategy is meaningless if someone leaks information?”
“Leaks information?”
“Class D’s success is due to the maneuverings of a mysterious person
I’ll refer to as ‘X.’ X has an ally in Class C—my class. There’s a spy among
Page 53
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
us,” said Ryuuen.
Everyone looked slightly confused.
Ibuki’s eyes widened in shock. “Wait, are you serious?” she asked.
“It’s true. It seems that my control over you isn’t strong enough. It’s
extremely unfortunate,” said Ryuuen.
He smiled as if he enjoyed the possibility of being spied upon.
Everyone in the room started praying that this would be over quickly.
“This nonsense is coming to an end right this instant,” said Ryuuen. He
slammed the top of the podium, silencing everyone. “First, I’ll ask directly.
The person who betrayed me, raise your hand.”
Of course, none of his classmates put up their hands. Some averted
their eyes and feigned ignorance, while others looked around to see whether
anyone came forward. Some stayed completely still to avoid drawing
attention to themselves.
“If you just step forward now, I’ll forgive you,” said Ryuuen. The
continuing silence seemed to delight him. “Yes. I knew that a spy would plan
to stay hidden. Don’t come forward. In fact, stay hidden at all costs.”
“Wait, what? You’re not seriously going to accept that Class C has a
traitor, are you?”
“Shut up, Ibuki. Don’t get in the way of my fun. I’ll bury you if you
do.” Ryuuen had been all smiles before, but his face twisted as he glared at
Ibuki. “I’ve actually tried not to get too violent so far. You may think I’m
lying, but it’s true. I’ve taken it easy on my opponents.”
He slammed the podium twice. BAM! BAM! It was the class’s death
knell.
“But maybe that was foolish. I mean, now we have a traitor among us.”
Ryuuen struck the podium once more. BAM! The sound reverberated
through the room. The timid students shook.
“So, we’re going to play a little game. A silly, childish little game
where we try to find the spy. For most students, there’s really no need to be
afraid. This shouldn’t take long at all; just thirty minutes,” said Ryuuen.
Despite his words, it was obvious that everyone was terrified. Even
Page 54
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Ibuki started to feel apprehensive.
“First things first. Take your phones out, and place them on your desks.
I’ll come by and check personally. Are there any idiots who didn’t bring their
phones? They should step forward immediately. One of them is the culprit,”
said Ryuuen.
The students immediately put their phones on their desks. Ishizaki
went around the room and collected them, attaching a label with the owner’s
name to each phone. The labels seemed to have been prepared ahead of time.
Ibuki handed her phone over to Ishizaki, looking dissatisfied.
“Ryuuen-san, I collected everyone’s phones,” said Ishizaki.
“Good work. Well, I think it’s time for a thorough investigation, don’t
you?”
“What should we check? The call histories?”
“Come now, as if someone trying to hide their identity would make an
incriminating call! Look at the email histories. Then look at the texts. Read
all of them, even if it’s just a minor conversation. The traitor might have used
an alias.”
“W-wait a minute! There are lots of really private messages on my
phone, though!” shouted one girl, her desire not to have Ryuuen see her
personal information outweighing the risk of him suspecting her.
“You really don’t want me to read what’s on your phone, Nishino?”
“Of course I don’t! Even if it’s just you, Ryuuen-kun!”
“Don’t be ridiculous, Nishino. You gave Ryuuen your phone on the
cruise ship, didn’t you?” said Ishizaki. “Why are you so—?”
“Th-this is different from back then! All he did on the cruise ship was
check the email I received from the school!”
Ryuuen listened to Nishino’s appeal with cold indifference. “You
know that this will make you a prime suspect, Nishino?”
“I-I will obey you, Ryuuen-kun, but there are some things I can’t
accept!”
Nishino wasn’t the type to argue, but in this case, it looked like she was
dead serious. She’d loudly announced that she had something on her phone
Page 55
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
that she didn’t want other people to see.
“Are you the spy, Nishino?” asked Oda.
“No, I’m not the spy!”
“But the fact that you’re hiding something is pretty suspicious.”
“I just want to protect my privacy!”
Ryuuen showed no interest at all in the current conversation. He
grabbed one of the phones. “This is your phone, Nishino?”
“Hey!” Nishino panicked, sure that he’d start reading her messages.
However, Ryuuen handed Nishino’s phone to Ishizaki. “Give this back
to her.”
“I-Is that okay? You didn’t check the contents.”
“I told you to give it to her.”
Ishizaki quietly returned Nishino’s phone. She and the other students
shook.
“Really, it’s not such a mystery. I confirmed your innocence, so I
returned your phone. That’s only natural, right? If it’s not the traitor’s phone,
then looking at it would be a waste of time and effort,” said Ryuuen.
“If anyone here thinks that what I’m doing is unacceptable, like
Nishino said, raise your hand,” he added. “However, prepare to come under
even more suspicion than she did.”
Faced with those two options, four girls and two boys raised their
hands, despite their fear.
“Six people are standing up to Ryuuen-san. The spy is definitely
among them, I’m sure of it! Nomura-san, you were the last one to raise your
hand. You’re not jumping on the bandwagon to save your own skin, are
you?” said Ishizaki.
“N-no, that’s not it! I’m not doing that!” said Nomura.
While Ishizaki hurled accusations, Ryuuen wore an eerie smile.
“Gather their phones.”
“Yes, sir.”
Page 56
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Ishizaki collected six phones and immediately handed them to Ryuuen.
“So, you’re okay with being my prime suspects as long as I don’t look
through your phones?” asked Ryuuen.
All six students agreed.
“You took quite a bit of time before you raised your hand, Nomura.”
“Huh? No, I didn’t—”
“You’ve been looking around all shifty-eyed. And you’re sweating,
hmm?”
“Huh?!”
Nomura had a very timid personality, and he seemed on the verge of
fainting. Ryuuen let out an amused chuckle before turning to Ishizaki once
more. “Ishizaki. These six are all innocent. Return their phones,” he ordered.
A second shock. No one other than Ryuuen himself could understand
this reasoning.
“Will you explain what’s going on here?” asked Ibuki.
“Later.” Ryuuen ran his hand through his hair and picked up Ibuki’s
phone. “Well then, let’s investigate the rest of the phones. I’ll start with
yours, Ibuki.”
“Do whatever you want.”
Page 57

4.1
 
Ryuuen checked everyone’s phones himself. The whole process took
about twenty minutes, no more than one minute per phone. He couldn’t have
checked all of them thoroughly. Even though the students had their doubts,
no one said anything.
For the spy, every second must have been agonizingly stressful.
“I see. No information seems to be recorded on these phones.”
“So, one of the people you thought were innocent—like Nishino—is a
traitor after all,” said Ibuki.
“No,” said Ryuuen.
“What are you doing here? Is there really even a spy?” asked Ibuki.
In her heart of hearts, she wondered whether Ryuuen had come up with
a story about a traitor to hide his own failure. Ryuuen had believed some
shadowy figure was puppeteering Horikita since the island test. So far,
however, there hadn’t been one shred of evidence that this mastermind even
existed. In fact, everyone else had focused on Horikita Suzune.
“Evidence trumps theory,” said Ryuuen. “Listen. I assume this is
something you all know quite well, hmm?”
He replayed an audio file that X had sent. The voice on the recording
was Ryuuen’s, explaining his strategy to Class C.
“I received this recording when I was about to force Suzune to kneel,”
Ryuuen continued. “Never mind the points—because of this, I didn’t get to
see Suzune beg. Do you understand now?”
“Wait a minute. Even if we assume that you didn’t just record that file
yourself, there are still questions that you need to answer. We never
discussed the details of getting Horikita to kneel before you. This other
person managed to anticipate everything, including the time you were
meeting her? That’s impossible,” said Ibuki.
“It was a coincidence. The best time for this other person to strike was
immediately after the festival ended. Besides, I don’t think he was interested
Page 58
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
in saving Suzune,” said Ryuuen. “X, Class D’s mastermind, had this audio
file. X clearly understood the details of the strategy I came up with. If he
knew all my plans, including leaking the participation table, he could have
foiled my attacks on Suzune at the sports festival. He could have prevented
Suzune from being crushed and having to beg for forgiveness. But he didn’t.
Even though X knew about my strategy, he allowed me to go about my
business and let Suzune suffer. She was injured, unable to keep competing,
and she had to suffer the guilt of injuring someone else as well.”
“So, by letting you get that far, this person turned the audio file into
incriminating material?” Kaneda asked. He was a bespectacled boy with a
mushroom cut.
“How very clever you are, Kaneda,” said Ryuuen.
“This X person’s thought process is so cruel. I mean, he just let his
friend get hurt.”
“Yes. X wasn’t bothered by me having Suzune kneel. That’s why there
wasn’t any text in his message. I think he couldn’t have cared less whether
Suzune’s pride was hurt or not,” said Ryuuen.
“I can’t understand that,” said Ibuki. “If they’re from the same class,
shouldn’t he have protected Horikita from the start?”
Other students probably shared Ibuki’s feelings. X had had several
options available, including altering Class D’s participation table to prepare
for Class C’s strategy, or sending the audio file to Ryuuen in advance.
“Wouldn’t X have thought to submit the audio file to the school?”
If X had given the audio file to the school after Class C carried out
their plans, it would’ve hurt Class C badly. If the school found out that Class
C had intentionally targeted Horikita and tried to extort points from her, it
probably would’ve kicked Ryuuen out.
With October already half over, however, that possibility had
practically vanished. Why would X do all this?
“X’s naivete accidentally saved us. Or perhaps he isn’t taking full
advantage of his assets. If Horikita-shi had finished transferring private points
over to Ryuuen-shi, then X would’ve been defeated,” concluded Kaneda.
“No, that’s not quite right,” said Ryuuen. “Even if Suzune had given
Page 59
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
up her private points, X probably could’ve recovered them by presenting the
audio. He could have threatened us with exposure, and that would’ve been
it.”
“So, he deliberately chose not to threaten us?”
“Yes. X allowed me to make Suzune kneel. That’s different from
winning or losing points. It’s not something a person can undo, right? I’m
saying that X is letting me torment Suzune.”
“I don’t get it. So, X has been helping Class C?” Ibuki said.
Unlike Ibuki, Ryuuen understood what X had done.
“Heh. So, you really don’t intend to reveal yourself, all the way to the
bitter end, eh?” he said to Class C.
If Ryuuen kept digging for the audio file’s source, he’d eventually
force X to reveal himself. He could even contact the school and request that
they provide him with email and call records. After thorough investigation,
he’d probably arrive at X’s identity.
In addition, Ryuuen didn’t get the feeling that X was fixated on
moving up to Class A at all. Gaining assets didn’t matter to X.
“I’m not sure what method X employed, but I’m certain that he thinks
like me, and that someone here is spying for him. If the spy knew X’s
identity, it’d be game over for X the moment I found them out. Therefore,
I’m certain that X used email or similar tactics to remain anonymous,” said
Ryuuen.
“But there wasn’t any proof on anyone’s phone,” said Ibuki. “You
didn’t even look at them carefully.”
“Of course I didn’t. That was just for show.”
“Huh? But you said you’d know the spy’s identity if you looked at our
phones.”
“Apply some common sense here. If you were the spy, would you
intentionally leave a suspicious email on your phone?”
“Well, no, I wouldn’t. That’s why I thought that checking our phones
was a waste of time.”
“Right. It was obvious how investigating everyone’s phones would
Page 60
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
turn out. The spy is someone who thought that they could look innocent just
by giving me their phone. Therefore, those who didn’t show me their phones
are innocent, whereas the spy wouldn’t have taken that chance,” said Ryuuen.
So, it had all been a stunt. Ryuuen hadn’t actually been looking for an
incriminating message on Class C’s phones. Rather, he was evaluating how
much the class feared him, and how much influence X had over the spy. And
his conclusion was…
“I’m going to ask the spy to show himself again.”
Ryuuen looked at each individual in the class, studying their body
language.
“Are you scared of this mysterious X? Or are you scared of me? Which
one should you truly fear? Are you sure you’re not making a big mistake?
Remember what happened after the entrance ceremony? You saw what
terrible fate befalls those who oppose me. Right, Ishizaki?”
“Y-yes…”
Ishizaki started trembling. Albert, who stood quietly by Ryuuen’s side,
also reacted slightly. Both Ishizaki and Albert had resisted Ryuuen at first,
but the violence he wielded had ultimately brought them to their knees.
“Violence is the most powerful force in the world. I will not yield to
authority. Even if the school tries to expel me, I’ll kill the traitor before they
kick me out. Do you understand? If I end up getting expelled because of this,
I will stomp the life out of the spy, like crushing a bug.”
This wasn’t former-president Horikita or current-president Nagumo’s
style of authority. Ryuuen wielded his insane violence like a sword.
“I’ll welcome the traitor’s confession even now. However, this is your
last chance. If you step forward and honestly admit what you’ve done, I
promise to forgive and forget. I also swear that I won’t let your classmates
harass you. As I said from the very start, if you believe in me, I’ll raise us all
to Class A. As long as you follow me, I will protect you.”
Ryuuen stepped down from the podium, gazing over every one of his
classmates.
“Do you understand what it means to make me angry?”
He looked them in the eye, one by one. Ryuuen stopped beside a
Page 61
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
female student, standing right in front of her. Of course, it wasn’t random.
He’d been targeting her since the start.
“What’s wrong? Can’t look me in the eye?”
“Ah…ah…I…” Her breathing was ragged. She appeared so terrified
that she seemed on the verge of tears.
“Heh. It’s you, isn’t it, Manabe? You’re the traitor.”
Most of the students were dumbfounded.
“Don’t be afraid, Manabe. Although you didn’t come forward and tell
me, I knew you were the spy from the very beginning. You’ve looked sick,
like it was written on your face. There was no way you could hide.”
Ryuuen brushed aside Manabe’s hair and caressed her face. Manabe
began trembling.
“I-I’m…I’m sorry. I-I—”
“Don’t worry. I forgive you. I will handle this with tolerance and
magnanimity. Tell me about it, hmm? Tell me about who this X really is.”
Ryuuen turned from Manabe Shiho, fixing his sharp gaze upon her
friends, Yabu Nanami and Yamashita Saki.
Page 62
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
4.2
 
After Ryuuen finished grilling everyone, he released Class C and
cleared the room. Only Ryuuen himself, Ishizaki, Kaneda, Ibuki, and the
three spies remained.
“Do you know who gave you instructions?”
Manabe and her friends denied it.
“Next question. Why did you betray Class C? Tell me.”
“That’s—”
“There’s no point in hiding. If you choose to stay quiet right now, then
tomorrow I won’t treat you as classmates anymore. You’ll all be treated like
worms, forever.”
Manabe and her friends had no choice but to tell the truth. “Do…do
you know a girl named Karuizawa Kei, from Class D?”
“Just her name and face. She’s Hirata’s girl, isn’t she?”
“She, um, well, she acts all tough, but…it seems she was bullied long
ago.”
“Oh?”
“Well, Karuizawa treated Rika horribly, so we thought we’d give her
some payback…”
Manabe explained to Ryuuen what’d happened on the cruise ship. She
told him the truth about everything, including how they were in the same
group as Karuizawa, and about Karuizawa’s past. The spies even told Ryuuen
about what they’d done to Karuizawa.
Manabe said that she began spying because she’d received threats
promising to expose her and her friends for what they did. If the truth came to
light, Manabe and her friends would be suspended, or worse.
“I see. Well, it sounds like you’ve been having quite a wild time.”
“What?” said Ibuki. “If they’re being threatened by someone they
don’t know, that hardly seems ‘wild.’”
Page 63
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Come on, Ibuki. When humans are cornered, they become such weak
creatures.” Ryuuen didn’t chastise the spies any further. “Here’s the big
question. Was anyone else there while you were bullying Karuizawa?”
Manabe and her friends nodded. “At the time, Yukimura-kun and
Ayanokouji-kun from Class D saw us.”
“Someone sent us a picture after. It was a photo of us with Karuizawa.”
“I see,” said Ryuuen. “I expected that there was some kind of evidence.
So, someone took your picture, huh? Where is it?”
“I-I deleted it. If someone saw it, then we…”
“I understand completely.”
“So, that means it’s either Yukimura-shi or Ayanokouji-shi, right?”
said Kaneda, who’d been quietly listening.
“Hold on, Ryuuen. I don’t know much about this Yukimura guy, but I
can’t really imagine that Ayanokouji is the one pulling the strings. Can you?
I’ve met him, and I don’t see him as the type.”
“Well, I suppose that Yukimura does look a little suspicious. He seems
pretty smart,” added Ishizaki.
“Can we really say that for sure, though? Ayanokouji-shi is always
with Horikita-shi, isn’t he? Moreover, Ayanokouji-shi hid his athletic
abilities until the sports festival. I think he’s the more suspicious of the two,”
said Kaneda.
“I think they’re both irrelevant. Ayanokouji is just quick on his feet,
and Yukimura is only good at studying, right? The mastermind would need
more than that.”
“Who else could it be?”
“There are other capable people in Class D. People like Hirata.”
“Him? I can’t imagine he’s this type of person.”
Ryuuen wore a thin smile while his classmates talked on and on. Then,
SLAM! He pounded his fist against the podium.
“Shut up.”
A terrified silence enveloped the entire room.
Page 64
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Did I ask for your opinions? I will find Class D’s puppet master. You
are nothing more than my pawns. Right now, the facts state that only
Yukimura or Ayanokouji could have taken that picture. However, concluding
that one of them is the mastermind merely because of that? No. They, too,
might be mere pawns acting under someone else’s orders,” said Ryuuen.
That was where things got complicated.
“But, Ryuuen-shi, shouldn’t we be especially suspicious of
Ayanokouji-shi?” Kaneda dared to speak up.
“I agree,” said Ryuuen.
With regard to Ayanokouji, he had felt something was fishy from the
beginning, primarily because of Ayanokouji’s connection to Horikita Suzune.
However, if Ayanokouji were the mastermind, and had been close to Horikita
Suzune from the beginning, he would never have let her be hurt.
“So, you’re saying that the real mastermind’s hiding right under our
noses? I find that hard to swallow.”
The situation felt hopeless.
“How about we try using him?” said Ryuuen.
They’d come this far; it made sense to go further. Ryuuen made his
next move and sent a text message.

Chapter 5:
A Means of Escape
 
After homeroom began at 6 p.m., Chabashira-sensei left the
classroom. Hirata, glancing sideways at the perplexed students, stood and
went up to the podium. No more time for games. We were about to have a
serious discussion.
“During homeroom today, I’d like to discuss our strategy for the short
quiz tomorrow. I’ve received Chabashira-sensei’s permission. First, Horikita-
san, would you please come up?”
Horikita stood and went to Hirata. Some students probably felt it was
weird to see the two in solidarity. Hirata had always welcomed a partnership
with Horikita, but until now, she never took him up on the offer. Horikita had
always fought alone.
The Swiss biologist A. Portmann said it best. He said that human
beings are born physiologically premature. He argued that, from a zoological
point of view, humans are born about a year early in comparison to other
mammals’ developmental states. When a human baby is born, its sensory
organs are developed, but its motor skills are not. On the other hand, many
large animals, like deer, are capable of moving on their own soon after birth.
Horikita might have been reborn, but she was still underdeveloped.
However, she contained limitless possibilities. Perhaps she still felt
conflicted, deep down. She was probably struggling. The best course of
action would be for her to change and accept it.
I thought Horikita would immediately start discussing the final exam,
but she didn’t. “First, there’s something I’d like to say. Please allow me to
apologize.”
Something appeared to have festered inside her heart for several weeks
now. “My performance during the sports festival was disappointing. Though
I act tough in front of you all, in the end, I didn’t do anything for Class D. For
that, I apologize.”
Horikita bowed her head deeply. Naturally, this display shook many
Page 67
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
students. Onodera, who had become a little distant with Horikita after the
three-legged race, spoke up in response.
“B-but it’s not like it’s only your fault we lost, Horikita-san. Please,
don’t bow to us. You don’t have to,” she said.
“That’s right, Suzune. I mean, Haruki and the Professor weren’t really
much help, either.” Sudou’s words were sad but true. Yamauchi and
Sotomura shot vexed glares at him.
“Regardless of whether you win or lose, a humble attitude makes it
easier to move on. But that’s not what I’m talking about here. I contributed
almost nothing to any area of the festival,” said Horikita.
She looked over at Sudou for an instant. By giving him that look, she
implied that the one thing she’d gained was becoming Sudou’s ally. Sudou
couldn’t have missed that message. While he scratched his cheek in
embarrassment, he smiled quietly.
“But now, I’m finished apologizing. Next, I’d like to use my energy to
take on the upcoming short quiz. Unless we all come together as a class, we
won’t get through this challenge.”
“I can understand that, but do you have a plan? Like, we don’t even
know how they choose the pairs yet.”
“Actually, the partner selection process has already been made clear. If
we handle things right, each student could feasibly end up with their ideal
partner. Hirata-kun, if you would.”
Hirata, now playing the role of Horikita’s support, wrote out the rules
on the blackboard.
Deciding How Pairs Are Formed:
After the school looks at the class as a whole, it will pair the highest-
scoring and lowest-scoring students.
This process will continue with the second-highest and second-lowest-
scoring students pairing up, and then the third-highest and lowest, and so on.
For example, the student with one hundred points will pair with the
student with zero points. The student with ninety-nine points will pair with the
student with one point.
Page 68
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Simple, right?” Horikita said.
“Wh-whoa! You cracked the code, Horikita! Awesome!”
“It’s fairly obvious. However, remember this: though students who
earn lower grades will almost automatically partner with students with higher
grades, there are always exceptions. I’m going to explain a strategy that we
can use to end up with reliable, appropriate pairs,” said Horikita.
She walked to Hirata and faced the classroom. Horikita was shy about
public speaking; it had to be taking all she had to keep facing forward.
“I’d like to have the students who worry about their grades partner up
with high scorers. However, looking at our grades so far, the truth of the
matter is that we can’t cover everyone,” said Horikita.
Eleven students had an average score of eighty points or higher. Only
six students had an average of ninety points or more. Meanwhile, the number
of students with an average of sixty points or below made up more than half
the class. In other words, it would be impossible to pair every low-scoring
student with a high-scoring counterpart.
Instead, therefore, Horikita aimed to create stability by forcing the top
ten and bottom ten students into specific partnerships. Hirata listed the
lowest-scoring students’ names on the blackboard, one by one.
“Um, I don’t really get it. What are we supposed to do?” asked
Yamauchi.
“It’s okay for the ten lowest-scoring students, whose names are written
here, to simply score zero points on this test. Since your final grades won’t
reflect your scores, that’ll do you no harm. Conversely, the ten highest-
scoring students should definitely try to score eighty-five points or above.
Similarly, we’ll divide the remaining twenty students in the class into two
groups of ten. The higher-scoring of those two groups should aim to score a
maximum of eighty points, while the lower-scoring group only needs to score
one point. By doing things this way, we automatically achieve a good balance
in our pairings,” said Horikita.
The important thing was to ensure that the students who scored zero
points and those who scored one point weren’t paired. We needed to ensure
that the school partnered the students with the most significant differences in
academic ability.
Page 69
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“I think this is a great plan.” Hirata didn’t dissent. He wanted to create
a harmonious atmosphere.
Kouenji usually refused to participate in anything, but he didn’t appear
to either support or reject the plan. Actually, it was more like he didn’t seem
interested whatsoever. His social skills were even worse than Horikita’s, but
for once, it didn’t matter that he was up to his usual tricks. Kouenji had
avoided the kind of results that would get him kicked out of school so far.
However, this time, it was possible that you could still fail the final exam
even if you got a perfect score, depending on how well your partner did.
That said, if we got Kouenji into a preselected pairing, he’d probably
be fine. In other words, while he might not be interested, he basically seemed
willing to cooperate. Actually, we didn’t know how Kouenji would react, in
some ways. He might be unpredictable.
“Do you have any objections, Kouenji-kun?”
“No. What a nonsensical question. Naturally, I fully grasp the
situation.” He rested his long legs across his desk and started combing his
hair, like always.
“Then would it be appropriate for me to expect you to score eighty
points or higher?”
“Well, I’m not too sure about that. Wouldn’t that depend on the test’s
contents?”
“If you intentionally scored a zero, and got matched with one of the
higher-scoring students, you’d destroy the balance we’re trying to achieve.
Do you understand that?”
The only thing to fear from this test was someone getting an irregular
score. If an academically gifted student like Kouenji deliberately held back,
he could throw off the class’s balance. We needed to avoid having highly
gifted students like Horikita and Kouenji paired together.
“I will consider the matter carefully, girl.”
Even though Kouenji’s response was suspicious, Horikita couldn’t
pursue the matter any further.

The day of the short quiz arrived, and though I expected us to start
immediately, Chabashira-sensei had something to discuss first.
“We will begin shortly, but I’d like to say something. You nominated
Class C as the class you wanted to attack for this test. Since there was no
conflict with any other class, your nomination was approved,” said
Chabashira-sensei.
“Did Classes A and B both nominate Class D, then?” It seemed we’d
managed to overcome our first obstacle, and Horikita was relieved.
“Class C will attack Class D. They also had no competing nominations
that conflicted with that decision.”
So, the battle was going to be Class D versus Class C, and Class B
versus Class A.
“That’s an ideal match-up,” said Horikita.
“Seems that way.”
Sakayanagi had likely chosen Class A’s nomination. Katsuragi
probably would’ve nominated Class D, as that would give Class A the
highest chance of winning. You could sense that Katsuragi’s influence was
on the decline.
Class C was our challenger, just as Horikita had hoped it would be.
“At any rate, you look like you’re doing quite well, Ike. Yamauchi, you
usually have dark circles under your eyes right before you take a test. Did
you happen to come up with some secret strategy?”
“Heh heh heh. Watch and learn, sensei.” Ike was completely self-
confident, as expected. He hadn’t needed to study at all. He could just write
down his name and turn in a blank sheet of paper. If he seriously tried to take
this unique exam, it would only increase the risks we’d face.
Chabashira-sensei had to see what was happening. “Don’t do
something you’ll regret later. It would be better if you took this quiz
seriously.”
Page 71
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Wh-what do you mean? This isn’t going to have an effect on my
grades, right?”
“Right. Your final grade won’t reflect your score on this at all.”
“In that case, I don’t need a good score,” said Ike.
“Sure. If things go the way you expect them to go, that is.”
What Chabashira-sensei said stirred our class’s anxiety. “Should we try
to get good scores after all?” muttered Sudou.
“Don’t get flustered. There are no problems with our plan,” said
Horikita.
Her calm, collected response managed to settle the students. Sudou
regained his composure instantly. “Yeah. All I have to do is believe in
Suzune.”
Chabashira-sensei produced the quiz papers. “Well then, let’s begin. I
needn’t remind you that no form of cheating is allowed. If someone gets
caught cheating, then there will be no mercy.”
The teacher handed stacks of paper to the students in the front row and
had them pass the tests back. Because we had to keep the paper facedown
until the test started, I immediately flipped mine upside down when I
received it.
“Aren’t you worried that you’re wrong about how the pairs are
selected?” asked Chabashira-sensei.
“Not at all. I’m confident that I’m right,” said Horikita.
She was unfazed by what Chabashira-sensei said. Ike and the others
could stand tall because of their leader’s confidence.
Class D was changing.
“Begin.” Chabashira-sensei gave the signal, and the test started.
I slowly turned the papers over. “Oh…”
I couldn’t help but make a noise. I probably wasn’t the only one who
was surprised. Though we’d expected that the difficulty level would be rather
low, it really was extremely easy. Even small children could have completed
this test. Of course, there were a few difficult questions in there, but even
someone like Ike could easily score around sixty or higher if he didn’t panic.
Page 72
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
It was a very tempting trap. If we’d gone rushing into this test
thoughtlessly, it could have been a disaster. However, that was exactly why
Horikita came up with her strategy.
Page 73

The short quiz ended without incident. The results were announced
the very next day. Class D had previously sat all its exams while lacking any
kind of cohesion, but we were so united this time that it felt almost too good
to be true.
“The best part is that it looks like I didn’t need to get involved,” I
muttered. I really was grateful for that.
“Well, I will now announce the pairings for the final exam,” said
Chabashira-sensei.
The short quiz’s results were as follows: Horikita Suzune and Sudou
Ken, Hirata Yousuke and Yamauchi Haruki, Kushida Kikyou and Ike Kanji,
Yukimura Teruhiko and Inogashira Kokoro.
The pairs were almost perfectly in line with what we’d predicted. My
partner was…Satou Maya.
“God really does have a bad sense of humor.”
How had it ended up like this? Satou noticed that she was paired with
me, and looked in my direction with a smile. I raised my hand to let her know
I’d noticed, too.
“It looks like Kouenji-kun acted just as we hoped he would this time.”
Kouenji was partners with Okiya. It seemed he’d gotten a sufficiently
high score. Well, he’d scored highly on every test thus far, so it was more
like business as usual. Kouenji crossed his arms, grinned, and let out a laugh.
“The results indicate that some among you understood this short quiz’s
purpose,” said Chabashira-sensei, sounding quite impressed as she glanced
over the list of partners. “Students were to be paired based on the difference
in points, with the highest scorer partnered with the lowest, and so on. If
students had the same scores, the pairings would have been determined at
random. It’s probably not necessary for me to explain the system, but I
thought I would anyway.”
Knowing that we’d been right on the money was a relief. “There don’t
Page 74
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
appear to be any blatant problems with the pairings,” I said to Horikita.
“Yeah. Everything’s been going so smoothly it’s almost scary. But the
real challenge starts now. How will we come up with our exam questions,
and how will we overcome the final? You’re paired up with Satou-san. You
should be fine.”
I hadn’t intentionally chosen Satou or anything. And I wasn’t entirely
safe—she might fail the exam. I needed to keep my scores high from this
point onward.
“I’ll hold study groups until the final exam to raise our class’s average
scores,” Horikita said. “If Hirata-kun and Kushida-san agree, I’d like to hold
two study sessions per day. There will be a two-hour session beginning at 4
p.m., right after classes end, until 6 p.m. The other two-hour session will be
held from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. We’ll each lead a session in turn. I’ll be counting
on you, Hirata-kun,” said Horikita.
“Because of my club activities, I’ll take the second study group. Let’s
all work together and do our best,” Hirata replied.
Things were certainly moving forward.
Horikita and Hirata discussed the study sessions’ format until they
nailed down the finer details. Kushida would attend both sessions and adopt a
unique role, tutoring the students who were worried about whether they could
reach fifty points.
That being said, this plan wasn’t free of problems. Compared to the
first-semester study group, significantly more students wanted a tutor, and
only three could handle being tutors. Naturally, the more students there were
per teacher, the lower the quality of instruction would be. When lunch came,
Horikita met with Hirata and Sudou.
“Dang it! Suzune’s not leading the second group? There goes my
motivation, man.” Sudou couldn’t attend the first session due to his club
activities, and was clearly unhappy to miss Horikita. Then again, the old
Sudou probably would’ve lashed out by now.
“No matter who’s teaching, it’ll bother me if you don’t try. Okay?”
said Horikita.
“Okay. We’re a team, after all,” he replied. Horikita had excellent
Page 75
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
control over the untamed stallion that was Sudou.
“Your efforts reflect on me,” she added. “I’d appreciate it if you
understand that. Besides, I’ll try to make appearances at the evening sessions
as often as I can.”
“Yeah! All right, I’m ready for this! I’m countin’ on you, Hirata.”
“Likewise. Let’s do our best together, Sudou-kun.”
“Excuse me, may I talk to you?” Miyake Akito asked, approaching
Horikita. I hadn’t ever really spoken to him before. He looked apologetic.
“What’s the matter, Miyake-kun?” asked Horikita.
Miyake was with Hasebe, a beautiful girl who was a frequent topic of
discussion amongst the boys. These two normally kept quiet and rarely
interacted with anyone. It was unexpected for them to approach Horikita.
“Wait, you two are paired together for the final exam, right?” asked
Hirata.
“Well, yes. We’re partners, but we’re equally good and bad at all the
same subjects. We’re a little nervous about how we’ll perform in the final, so
we wanted to ask for your advice.”
Miyake handed Hirata their completed answer sheets for both the short
test and the midterm. Their scores on the short test stood in stark contrast,
with Miyake getting seventy-nine points and Hasebe getting one point, as
intended. However, their midterm scores were sixty-five and sixty-three,
respectively. There was almost no difference in academic ability between
them. They were both exceptionally average, but they’d still been split
between the upper and lower groups.
At first glance, it looked as though they could probably score high
enough to pass the final, but there was a problem. Miyaki and Hasebe got the
exact same kinds of questions wrong. To pass, they needed a score of at least
sixty points for every subject. This would be a perilous bridge to cross.
“I see,” said Hirata. “This is a little unexpected. Let’s make sure to
check the other pairs later.”
“I’m sorry to bother you, Hirata, really,” replied Miyake. “I’m always
causing trouble for you, between the cruise ship and the sports festival.”
Page 76
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
That made me think back to the sports festival. Miyake withdrew from
the final relay because he hurt his leg. It looked like he moved without any
problems now, so his injury must have completely healed.
“Please, don’t apologize,” said Hirata. “If I had trouble, I’m sure you’d
do the same for me.”
The answers that Miyake and Hasebe got right and wrong on their
sheets were extraordinarily similar. In fact, they were so similar you might
think the same person took both tests.
“This is really unfortunate,” added Miyake. “I don’t want to complicate
your plans or mess up the study groups.”
You could tell that the two were by no means unintelligent. The
problem was that they were too similar. Because of that, group tutoring was
going to be insufficient. One-on-one tutoring was necessary.
“Kushida-san, could I ask you to take on additional students? These
two should have a pretty strong foundation that won’t bring down the group’s
overall cohesion,” said Horikita.
“Sure,” replied Kushida. “If you’re all right with that, Miyake-kun and
Hasebe-san, I’ll do it.”
Miyake didn’t appear to accept or reject Kushida’s offer, but Hasebe
spoke up. “I’m going to pass, I think. I don’t get along too well with
Ichihashi-san and the others.” Fortunately, Ichihashi and the other girls
weren’t in the classroom and didn’t hear that remark. “Besides, I’m not really
good at studying in a group with a lot of people.”
It seemed Miyake was the one who had wanted to come to Hirata for
help, while Hasebe hadn’t been too keen on it.
“But if you take the final exam as is, even if you clear the overall score
requirement, you might score under sixty points somewhere,” Horikita said.
“Yeah, I know,” replied Hasebe. She averted her eyes from Horikita
and started walking away.
“Where are you going?”
“Miyacchi, I’m sorry to have wasted your time, but I guess this just
isn’t the right fit for me,” said Hasebe. With that, she left the classroom.
Page 77
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Sorry, Horikita,” Miyake muttered.
“I don’t mind. Well, even if it’s just you, would you mind studying
with Kushida-san?” asked Horikita. If Miyake improved his weakest subjects,
he could effectively cover for Hasebe, too.
“I’ll pass. I don’t really feel like I could study with a group of just
girls. I’ll try and do it on my own,” he replied. He got up, grabbed his bag,
and left.
Horikita couldn’t force anyone to study. If a student didn’t participate
of their own free will, it would be nearly impossible to get any results. It
would probably lower the serious students’ morale to boot.
“What now?” asked Hirata. “I think we should follow up with those
two.”
“Yeah. If only we had another tutor,” said Horikita.
She glanced at me, so with my own eyes, I sent her a message saying
“absolutely not.” Putting aside whether I could even do the tutoring, I wasn’t
sure I could communicate with Miyake and Hasebe.
“I’ll see if I can make time,” Horikita muttered.
“I don’t think that’s a good idea. You’ll overwork yourself. If you do
that, you won’t be an effective tutor. Besides, Horikita-san, you also have to
create Class C’s test problems,” said Hirata.
“But what other choice do I have?”
“In that case, I’ll take care of tutoring them,” said Yukimura, inserting
himself casually into our conversation.
“We’d be glad to have you aboard, Yukimura-kun. You’re diligent and
academically gifted. But are you all right with this? I thought you didn’t
really like this kind of thing?”
“If I don’t help out where I can, we won’t be able to pass the test,”
Yukimura said. “Same goes for you, Horikita. You can’t do everything
yourself. There’s just one problem. I can teach Miyake and Hasebe how to
study, but I’m not friendly with them. After seeing what happened here
earlier, I get the feeling that talking to them will be tricky. I was hoping you
could do the work of convincing them to study with me.”
Page 78
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
That was a small price to pay, under the circumstances. Horikita was
overjoyed. Yukimura was like the cavalry in a movie—the sort who arrives in
the nick of time, charging over the hill to save the cornered protagonists.
“I’ll think of something,” Horikita promised. Yukimura left the
classroom, and she turned to me. “Is it okay to be optimistic for now?”
“Not necessarily. You don’t know how to talk to those two, either,” I
told her.
“Hirata-kun, do you think Miyake and Hasebe will listen to Yukimura-
kun?” she asked.
“I’m not sure. All three of them are loners,” said Hirata.
Horikita turned to me after a moment of thought. “Hey, Ayanokouji-
kun. Would you manage Yukimura-kun and the others?”
“Manage?”
“You were Yukimura-kun’s roommate on the cruise ship, so I thought
you might have broken the ice with him. Miyake-kun and Hasebe-san could
be difficult, but with you as the middleman, I think it’ll be easier for us to
communicate with them,” said Horikita.
Well, it was probably as good a plan as we had. Still, why me? I’d been
happy not getting involved for once.
“All you need to do is help corral them into studying with Yukimura. I
didn’t say I wanted you to teach them.” Although that was true, just
managing Miyake and Hasebe likely wouldn’t be an easy task. “Can I count
on you?” Horikita asked.
Her request was morphing into a threat. All I could do was nod. I just
didn’t want to have to do anything truly exhausting, like tutoring or preparing
test questions.
“I’ll do what I can.” I sighed, but made sure that Horikita didn’t notice.
Page 79

I started preparing immediately. I spoke to Yukimura, then got in
touch with Miyake. We talked about holding a study session later.
Unfortunately, it wasn’t going to be so easy.
As soon as class ended, Hasebe vanished from the room. “Huh?
Where’s Hasebe?”
“Did she run away?” muttered Yukimura.
“Hasebe isn’t like that,” said Miyake. “Maybe she just went on ahead
of us?”
“Why would she need to?”
“A bunch of different reasons.” Miyake seemed to understand Hasebe
quite well, and wasn’t especially worried.
We decided to head toward Pallet, our designated study hangout. En
route to the café, we saw Hasebe in the hallway.
“Why did you rush out?” pressed Yukimura.
“What? Maybe I just don’t like standing around. Hanging out in a
group is a little awkward,” she replied.
Yukimura seemed to take this as a personal attack. “So, you hate being
seen talking to us?” he asked.
“That’s not it at all. There are a lot of reasons.”
“Don’t sweat it, Yukimura. Hasebe’s just like this,” said Miyake.
“Well, all the seats at Pallet will probably be taken while we stand
around talking. Let’s keep moving,” I suggested. I understood how Yukimura
felt, but we needed to stay on target.
“Yeah, you’re right. Let’s go,” replied Yukimura, regaining his
composure and taking the lead.
“You should be a little more careful about what you say,” Miyake told
Hasebe.
Page 80
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Was it that annoying? I’ll think about it, I guess,” she replied.
Page 81
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Page 82
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
We managed to secure four seats at Pallet. Yukimura sat next to me,
while Hasebe sat across from us. Miyake was beside Hasebe. The four of us
clearly felt incredibly uncomfortable and out of place.
“Um, I guess I’m counting on you, or whatever,” said Hasebe.
“Well, if you have any questions, feel free to ask,” I told everyone.
Hasebe raised her hand. “So, you can talk, Ayanokouji-kun?”
“Is that really the question you’re going to ask?”
Hasebe looked as if her interest was piqued. “I guess I don’t have any
impression of you at all. Do people even notice when you’re not there?” she
continued.
Well…I mean, I didn’t talk to Hasebe on a regular basis, or at all. So,
maybe it was understandable that she had that kind of impression.
Miyake brought up the sports festival. “But Ayanokouji was awesome
in the relay.”
“Seems that way. But I went to the bathroom during that race, so I
missed seeing it. It all feels kinda bizarre to me. Didn’t you compete against
the former student council president? That’s what everyone was buzzing
about right after the festival ended,” said Hasebe.
“Did you do track and field back in junior high, Ayanokouji? After
seeing you run, a talent scout from the track and field club came looking for
you,” said Miyake.
“Ah, yeah. I got some offers. But I refused,” I replied. The track and
field club’s enthusiasm was only temporary. They couldn’t keep trying to
recruit me forever. The people in the club probably weren’t talking about me
anymore. “To be honest, I’ve never been in a club before. I don’t really know
much about that stuff.”
“Oh, really? What a shame,” said Miyake.
Yukimura just listened, never speaking once. Hasebe, disinterested,
switched the conversation’s topic to Miyake. “Miyacchi is in the archery
club. Is it fun shooting bows every day?”
“I wouldn’t do it if it wasn’t fun. By the way, you don’t shoot the bow,
just arrows,” he replied.
Page 83
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“I’m just not interested in clubs, I guess. I’m fine with spending time
by myself,” said Hasebe.
My current impression of these two was quite different from what I’d
previously imagined. They were far more talkative than I thought.
“Hey, Miyacchi. Is it okay for you to miss your club stuff?” asked
Hasebe.
“I took time off.”
“Wow. You shouldn’t do that.”
“When something takes priority, I focus on it. Besides, my club’s
pretty lenient.”
“Excuse me? I’d like to say something before we begin,” said
Yukimura. Finally, he’d spoken up. He focused not on Miyake or Hasebe, but
on me. “No hiding anything, Ayanokouji.”
“Huh? What do you mean?”
“Studying. Horikita says you’re quite capable.”
“Ugh, Horikita,” I muttered. What a blabbermouth. I needed to give
Yukimura something if I wanted to earn his trust. “Well, I’m relatively good
at memorizing things. I think I can get a pretty high score if I concentrate.”
“Are you the type to hide his abilities?”
“Well, I can’t hold a candle to you, Yukimura. Please don’t expect too
much of me. I’m not very good at teaching,” I replied.
“You should take this study group seriously, then. With me tutoring
you, you’ll definitely score higher than you did on the midterm.” Yukimura
turned to Hasebe and Miyake. “Did you bring your answer sheets from the
midterm and first semester exams like I asked?”
“Yeah,” said Hasebe.
Miyake nodded as well. They took their test papers from their bags and
handed them over. I glanced at their papers and scores.
“Both of you excel in the sciences. Your humanities scores are a
complete disaster,” said Yukimura.
Miyake and Hasebe had scored relatively high in math, earning around
Page 84
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
seventy points. But they only got about forty points in language and world
history. It was obvious why the two of them were worried.
“I didn’t know you two were so close,” added Yukimura.
“Well, Hasebe came and talked to me when I was studying in the
library one day,” said Miyake.
“Miyacchi and I are both independent people. We don’t really fit in
with everyone else,” Hasebe added.
“I feel the same, in a way,” said Miyake. “Even in this group, I feel
awkward and distant.”
“So, why did you agree to join us?” asked Yukimura.
“Because this isn’t really a club, I guess. It’s just a study group.
Besides, it’ll be quiet, right? When I study by myself, nothing bothers me or
gets in the way.”
Suddenly, I felt as if someone was watching me. I turned around.
Several male students, each on the phone with somebody, were in fact eyeing
us. I recognized three of them; all were from Class C. I only recalled the
name of the one in the middle, Ishizaki.
Hopefully, they weren’t about to drag me into another troublesome
mess. It didn’t seem like Ishizaki and the others were picking a fight.
Although they looked at me now and again, they walked over to the display
case next to the register. The case was lined with various cakes, which you
could either order to go or enjoy there in the café. The strawberry shortcake
and blancmange appeared especially popular, but I wasn’t exactly
knowledgeable about that stuff.
The cashier seemed to be having some difficulty hearing what the
Class C students wanted to order. Before long, she looked anxious and
apologetic.
“There’s no way you can do it?!” roared Ishizaki. The lively café
quieted at once.
“Sir, we need to have at least one week’s advance notice for any
special-order cakes,” the cashier replied. “I’m afraid it’s not possible to
prepare something on the same day.”
After hearing the cashier’s response, people began chatting in the café
Page 85
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
once again.
“What’s that all about?” asked Hasebe. She twirled her pen around and
looked at Ishizaki and his friends with disgust.
“Who knows? Doesn’t have anything to do with us,” replied
Yukimura. He was writing something down on Hasebe and Miyake’s test
papers, probably figuring out which subjects they were having trouble in and
coming up with a plan.
“Cake, huh?” I wasn’t the least bit interested in what Ishizaki was
talking to the cashier about, but the topic of cake reminded me that it was my
birthday tomorrow. Honestly, I didn’t know how to spend a birthday like a
normal person. My birthday always meant that I was simply another year
older.
I knew that a birthday was often celebrated with family, a lover, or
friends. I just didn’t understand what I should feel.
“What’s the matter, Ayanokouji-kun?”
“Nothing.”
Tomorrow was October 20. Some other students or teachers might
share my birthday. The only difference between those people and me was that
I didn’t have anybody to celebrate with. I wondered whether someone would
acknowledge my birthday next year.
Page 86

“I’m going to get another coffee,” said Hasebe.
“Me too,” said Miyake. More than thirty minutes had passed, and
Yukimura still hadn’t looked up from their papers.
Hasebe and Miyake went to the counter with their empty cups. Pallet
had a policy that, if you brought your receipt, you could get another cup for
half price. The coffee was inexpensive and delicious, and the café offered the
perfect amount, so it was becoming quite popular amongst the first-year
students. Hasebe and Miyake were already on their third cups. Yukimura,
still focused, had half of his first coffee remaining.
“Seems like hard work,” I said.
“I’ve never really taught someone else how to study before. I mean, a
long time ago, I taught this one junior-high
idiot to pull an all-nighter, but I couldn’t stand it. I wasn’t able to
concentrate on the material, because he didn’t have the fundamentals down,”
said Yukimura.
He briefly set down his pen and looked up at the ceiling.
“Even now, I can’t forget the time I wasted. I thought it was so stupid,
trying to teach people how to study. When you and Horikita rounded up those
guys who were about to fail, and held those study sessions, honestly, I was
laughing at you. The same goes for Hirata’s group. I mean, doesn’t it seem
like a waste? Nearly everyone who hates studying just can’t study in the first
place. I felt like teaching them to cram for a couple days was useless, since
they’d just go back to how they were before.”
“So, why did you decide to help tutor?” I asked. This test was unlike
anything in junior high. Yukimura was taking on some significant
responsibility. If Hasebe and Miyake did get expelled, he might blame
himself. That was the kind of person he was.
“I was useless in the sports festival. I got tripped up by the thing I
dismissed as unimportant. Just being able to study isn’t enough for this
Page 87
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
school. Just being athletic isn’t enough. If you combine those two things, that
still isn’t enough. Even people like Horikita and Hirata, who are gifted both
academically and athletically, definitely can’t make it through the challenges
ahead with just those skills alone. Intuition, insight, and taste. We have to
rely on those traits, which are essential for living in society. Working as a
team is vital. That’s the only way we win,” said Yukimura. “So, I decided to
help. Also, I was self-centered. I thought I’d be fine as long as I could study.
All I worried about was myself. I was just like my selfish mother. That’s why
I took a good hard look at myself, and… Ah, that’s not important. Forget it.”
He looked down. “If I had to tutor Ike and the other guys, I’d probably
have a much worse time of it. Miyake and Hasebe both take their studies
seriously, so it might be easy. Besides, they’re already good at science. It
shouldn’t be too hard to cover the rest. I don’t know much I’ll be able to help,
but we’ll probably see at least some improvement.”
Such positive thinking. Well, Yukimura probably realized that this was
where he could do the most good.
“I’m going to the bathroom,” I said.
Hasebe and Miyake hadn’t returned. Since it seemed like it’d be a little
while yet before our study session started, I got up to leave.
The real reason was that I felt Ishizaki and his friends gazing at me.
Also…I felt someone else’s presence. Someone was secretly watching
me, so I walked straight over and sat next to my new stalker. She didn’t seem
to notice me stroll up.
“What are you doing out here, Sakura?” I asked.
“Hyaaah?!” Sakura practically jumped out of her seat in fear. “I-It’s
just a coincidence, Ayanokouji-kun!”
“A coincidence, huh?”
“Yes, a coincidence.”
“Well, I thought you were looking over at me from time to time.”
“Well, that’s… I mean… I’m sorry.” Sakura immediately apologized.
“Is there anything you want to talk to me about?” If it wasn’t urgent,
she could just have called or sent an email. She wasn’t the type to hang out at
Page 88
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Pallet with friends. “Did you want to join the study group?”
“Wh-wh-why do you say that?!”
“Well, I see study materials in your bag.” That was odd, because
Sakura would never choose to study in such a crowded place.
“Ah…um!” Sakura panicked and tried to close her bag, but it was too
late. The way she was acting screamed that she wanted to participate.
“Well, why not sit with us? I’ll ask everyone else.”
“B-but I…I’ve hardly ever spoken to them before.” Sakura wasn’t
good at interacting with people. I understood that much.
“Well, you probably came here for a specific reason. I mean, the
Sakura I know likely wouldn’t come all the way to Pallet and risk bumping
into people pointlessly,” I told her.
Being in public still wasn’t easy for Sakura. She’d probably been
tempted to leave or run back to her dorm, but managed to keep herself here.
That meant something was going on in her mind.
“Well, you decide, Sakura. It’s not totally up to me. We have to
consider how Yukimura, Hasebe, and Miyake would feel,” I said.
Sakura might be dejected to hear me say that, but her passivity could
be bad for her. If I wanted her to step up and grow, the best plan of action
was to keep my distance and watch over her. Then again, I felt as though
communicating with Miyake and Hasebe was relatively easy, compared to
the rest of our classmates. I’m sure Sakura felt the same.
“It’s okay if you want to think about it. We’ll probably be here for
another hour,” I told her.
Though it might have been a little cold of me, I left Sakura and
returned to my seat. Yukimura glanced at me and said nothing. After about
two minutes, Miyake and Hasebe returned.
“Did you finish checking everything?” Miyake asked.
“Just a little longer,” replied Yukimura.
“Ah, that reminds me. There’s something I want to ask you,
Ayanokouji-kun,” said Hasebe.
“Knock it off, Hasebe,” said Miyake. Well, this sounded ominous.
Page 89
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Come on, it’s fine. It’s not like it’s the end of the world if someone
hears,” said Hasebe.
“That’s not the problem. There’s a time and place for this,” he replied.
Very ominous.
“Well, classes are done for the day. Isn’t right now the absolute best
time to talk?” Hasebe countered.
Miyake shook his head, as if he didn’t know what to do. What in the
world was Hasebe up to?
“Ayanokouji-kun, are you going out with Horikita-san?” she asked.
“Nope.”
“Whoa. Not even a pause to think about it? I’d say it sounded like that
answer was pretty well-rehearsed. Kinda suspicious, don’t you think?”
“Several people already asked, that’s why. It’s not like Horikita and I
are always together or anything,” I answered.
“I suppose. But you know what they say—rumors about love are half
truths, half lies.”
For a solitary girl, Hasebe really seemed interested in romance. I
suppose a sensible man in this situation would see whether Hasebe had a
boyfriend. Of course, I wasn’t going to do that.
“Okay.” Yukimura suddenly lifted his head. It seemed he’d finished
checking everything. “I feel like I’ve figured out where you two struggle. I’d
like to propose a detailed study plan.”
He handed Miyake the test papers, his comments written in the
margins.
“I tried coming up with some sample questions for you to solve. I’ll
have Hasebe work on the same problems later, so don’t write your answers
directly into my notebook. The time limit is ten minutes. There are ten
questions in total,” said Yukimura.
Miyake took the notebook. After he’d struggled for ten minutes, he
passed it to Hasebe so she could do the same.
When the twenty-minute testing period ended, Yukimura immediately
began writing down their scores.
Page 90
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Seriously, you two…”
He returned their answer sheets, letting out an exasperated sigh.
Miyake and Hasebe had each gotten only three answers correct and six
incorrect, and each scored half points on one question. What was really
surprising was that they managed to get the exact same questions right and
wrong.
“You don’t just have similar strengths. You also tend to memorize
things in exactly the same way,” said Yukimura.
“Wow! Doesn’t it feel as if this is kind of like fate, Miyacchi?” Hasebe
asked.
“No, it doesn’t.”
“Oh, come on. You never play along. But, uh, isn’t this kind of a
problem?” she asked Yukimura.
“Actually, this situation is convenient. It’ll only take half the effort to
solve.”
If Hasebe and Miyake’s academic skills and tendencies were that much
in sync, then Yukimura could basically think of it as actually teaching one
person. Of course, there’d be at least a few minor differences between them,
but everything would proceed more smoothly than expected.
“Do you think this is going to be easy?” Mikaye asked.
“Well, that depends on how much effort you’ll put in. Even though the
questions I came up with were kind of basic, your scores weren’t good. I’d
like us to meet up seven or eight times before the final. Rather than tutoring
constantly, it’ll be good to give you some time for self-study, too. Are you
three okay with that? Miyake, you might have conflicts with club activities,
right?”
“Since the final exam is getting closer, we’ll probably take a break
from club activities, but let me ask for the time off,” replied Miyake.
Yukimura nodded. That just left Hasebe.
“Okay, so let me just ask one thing,” she said. “Won’t this just feel like
typical studying? I mean, I don’t like studying or anything, but if this is just
reviewing stuff, I think I can do it on my own. So, how does a group help?
Obviously, I understand that having a smart person tutor me is good and all.
Page 91
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
But I came here because Miyacchi recommended it, and I’m still on the
fence.”
“This isn’t a normal study group. If this were a regular test, the school
would prepare the questions. But this time, another class will write them.
These questions won’t be standardized and easy to study for. With other
students making problems, there are unknown variables. It’ll be difficult to
anticipate them. That’s exactly why studying’s necessary,” said Yukimura.
Miyake was convinced. “Yeah, you’re right. I’m sure Class C will try
to trip us up.”
“Yeah,” Yukimura said. “Well, the questions might seem impossible
for us to imagine right now, but what if we identify the people coming up
with them? Personally, I think Kaneda will do it.”
I’d heard that name before.
“He’s that one creepy weirdo with the glasses, right?” asked Hasebe.
“I don’t know if I’d put it like that, but yeah. He’s the best student in
Class C,” said Yukimura. It was reasonable to assume that the best student
would make the questions.
“But if Class C is trying to trick us, won’t Ryuuen or maybe Ishizaki
come up with some, too?”
“No way. Without a thorough understanding of the subject, they won’t
be able to come up with anything. Take you two, for example. Think about
subjects you’re poor at, like the humanities. Do you really think you’d be
able to create a tricky question?” asked Yukimura.
“No. I wouldn’t even be able to think of a question.”
“Yeah. Besides, what kind of social studies problems would even be on
the test?”
“Exactly. At best, you’d think of the most obvious problems. Even if
you scoured the textbook for the really difficult parts, if you didn’t establish
the problem properly, the school would probably turn it down,” said
Yukimura.
“It’s ultimately up to the school to decide whether to use a question,
right?” I interjected.
Page 92
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“True,” said Yukimura.
“So, if Class D deliberately submits a number of extreme questions that
border on going too far, that would give us a better sense of what’s
acceptable?” I asked.
“That’s certainly a good idea,” said Miyake.
“You’re really smart, Ayanokouji-kun,” said Hasebe.
“We’ll probably need to come up with provisional questions as soon as
possible so we can identify the school’s standards. I’ll try to create questions
myself, but would Horikita and Hirata be willing to help out?” Yukimura
asked.
“I dunno. I’m just spitballing here.”
“You’re the only person who can get in touch with them, Ayanokouji,”
Yukimura said. Miyake and Hasebe nodded.
“Well, I’ll do whatever I can. Just don’t expect too much of me,” I
replied. Did Horikita and Yukimura both intend to make me their
middleman?
“Yeah. Okay.” Hasebe smiled, her doubts about the study group gone.
“Well, I’m not in any clubs, so I’m good. Let’s decide when to meet based on
what works for Miyacchi.”
Miyake looked over at Hasebe in surprise. “I thought you were going
to back out, Hasebe. This is unusual. You don’t normally want to get
involved in anything.”
“If it were just me getting expelled, I wouldn’t care. But I don’t want to
drag you down with me, Miyacchi. You know?”
“Well, I suppose this is enough for today. The first study session is the
day after tomorrow.” Yukimura brought things to a close.
As we got up to leave, I realized Sakura still hadn’t come over to talk
to us.
Page 93

After I returned to my dorm, I immediately contacted Horikita for
instructions.
“This is good. We’ll definitely want to test the school,” she said.
“Hirata and I are already making progress coming up with questions, but I’d
like to know just how far we can go. I’m glad that everything seems to be
going well, but are we really sure that Kaneda-kun will be the person in Class
C creating questions?”
“There’s no way to be sure,” I replied. “But trying to anticipate the
kinds of questions Kaneda would come up with is certainly one way we can
handle these study sessions.”
“I suppose. If we imagine that this test will be full of difficult
questions, we might need to try to get eighty or ninety points,” said Horikita.
“By the way, how did the study group go?”
I told her what had happened, though I did exaggerate a little. I tried to
make it sound as though I’d managed to make friends. Horikita didn’t touch
on that subject at all. She only cared about Hasebe and Miyake’s academic
abilities.
“It’s quite the coincidence,” she mused.
“I know, right? For the time being, I’ll see what I can do. They seem
easy enough to supervise, anyway,” I said.
“Thank you. Also, there’s one more thing. On the days when
Yukimura-kun’s study group doesn’t meet, would you please come to mine?”
“That’s not what we agreed.”
“You don’t have to tutor. I just want you to manage everyone,”
Horikita replied.
The word “manage” was vague, so vague that I had absolutely no clue
what she meant. I understood it as much as I understood the expression
“more than friends, less than lovers.” Which was to say, not at all.
“What do you mean, ‘manage’?” I asked.
Page 94
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
She sighed heavily.
“Too many people need tutoring, compared to the number who can
teach. I can’t keep my eye on everyone, no matter how hard I try. I’d like you
to make sure everybody studies properly,” said Horikita.
“The teachers manage to teach dozens of students all by themselves,
right?”
“At the risk of sounding self-aggrandizing, it’s not as though even our
teachers can watch everyone by themselves. That’s why you have some
students, like Ike-kun, who fall behind. Even if they fool the teacher into
thinking they understood, in the end, they struggle to keep up,” said Horikita.
“Yukimura-kun isn’t accustomed to tutoring, and I’m having trouble with the
sheer number of people I have to teach. Ike-kun and Yamauchi-kun are
especially problematic. They have shorter attention spans than a
kindergartener. Any objections?”
“None.”
“Excellent.”
“It’s okay if I don’t go to the night sessions, right?”
“That’s fine. The nighttime study sessions are significantly better than
the daytime ones, anyway, though some of the girls in that group can be
troublesome,” said Horikita.
I guessed that some girls only showed up at the sessions to be around
Hirata and didn’t mind that Karuizawa was there. That had to be an
interesting dynamic.
I realized that Horikita didn’t mention Sudou among those causing
issues. “Has Sudou been behaving?”
“Yes. He’s taking this seriously, though he still hasn’t reached junior
high level yet.”
“I’m counting on you.” I still didn’t have a good feeling about this.
“Oh, yeah. While we’re on the subject of the study groups, what about
Kushida?”
“What do you mean?”
“Has nothing changed with her?”
Page 95
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Of course not. I do think that she’ll help. She also promised to attend
the study sessions every day,” said Horikita.
I supposed that, as far as Horikita was concerned, there wasn’t much to
worry over. After all, it was just the very first day of the study sessions. From
my point of view, though, we simply couldn’t kick back and casually watch
this problem develop.
“Have you started creating test questions?”
“Of course I have. Mine, Hirata-kun’s, and Yukimura-kun’s will form
the fundamental basis. I wanted more people to help, but the more classmates
I involve, the greater the risk that the problems will leak to Class C,” said
Horikita.
“It’d certainly be difficult to rule out any possibility of leaks if we
factored in Kushida. Wait, aren’t you and her both participating in the
evening study sessions?”
“Yes, but as long as we don’t ask for her help with the test questions, it
should be okay.”
This was pure speculation on both our parts. “Our test questions and
answers are Class D’s lifeline. If that information leaks, we’re doomed,” I
said.
“I’ll keep things locked down. But that alone won’t solve the issue,
will it?”
“I’m not worried about the ‘creating questions’ part. If anything, I fear
what comes after we submit them to the school. If you give the final
questions and answers to Chabashira-sensei the day before the test, then
they’ll be out there, ready to be stolen,” I told Horikita.
Kushida had employed a similar tactic with the participation table
during the sports festival. It was more than likely that Ryuuen would make a
similar request of her again.
“So, the only way we can deal with this is by talking it out with
Kushida,” said Horikita.
“But what do we do if she leaks our questions to Class C?” I countered.
“I don’t want to think about it,” she said.
Page 96
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“You have to. This is about all of Class D. No matter how much we
study, if our opponents get a hundred points across the board, we have no
hope of winning,” I told her. If Class C memorized all our answers, defeat
was certain.
“I see what you’re saying. But I’m dealing with it. It’s already past ten
o’clock. I’d like to come up with at least one more question before I go to
bed.”
She hung up. My phone’s battery was low, so I plugged it in to charge.
Horikita said she was working on countermeasures, but I didn’t know
how well they’d go. I wasn’t criticizing her strategy to persuade Kushida
directly, but rather, didn’t have much to say about it. If I had to bring
Kushida over to my side, I’d threaten her like Karuizawa. No—I’d probably
need to do something far worse to make Kushida surrender to me. However, I
didn’t know the details of Kushida’s past, and she might not fold under
pressure.
“What should I do?” I muttered.
Then, I received an email from Ryuuen.
After the sports festival, I’d asked Manabe and her friends for
Ryuuen’s email address and sent him a message. I hadn’t received a response
until now.
What are you?
That was the entire message. I wasn’t nice enough to answer him, and
besides, he couldn’t trace my email. It was a dummy account.
I decided to go to sleep.

The library bustled after classes ended, absolutely full of students.
Although it was crowded, it was quiet. Most students were completely
immersed in studying.
“Wow. So, this is the library, huh?” muttered Satou. She sounded
interested.
Ah, yes. That brought me to my own little problem. Satou had decided
to join the study session. I hadn’t spoken to her since we exchanged contact
information. This was extremely awkward.
“This is my first time here. What about you, Ayanokouji-kun?”
“I’ve been a few times,” I replied.
“You’re so studious!”
“Well, it’s more like I come here to kill time.”
“You come to the library to kill time? That’s strange.”
Apparently, my pretty-generic answer was weird. I had no idea what to
think. I just didn’t know what Satou was trying to do.
“Hey, um, Ayanokouji-kun… I’m not a bother, am I?” she asked.
“What do you mean?”
“Well, I did just suddenly tell you I was joining the study session and
all.”
“I don’t mind. Horikita and Kushida are the ones tutoring, and they
should be happy to have more people.”
“That’s not what I mean.”
Satou looked a little depressed. Being in the library was kind of
annoying; I had to whisper to avoid bothering other students, and as a result,
got far closer to Satou than I normally would’ve. I could practically feel her
breath on my skin.
Was this a youthful moment of hedonism? If so, youth was kind of a
Page 98
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
pain in the butt. I wasn’t enjoying this in the slightest. I was nervous and
worried about Satou.
I basically just wanted to go home.
But…did I really?
I tried to examine my current situation. I could certainly grow
perplexed when faced with the unknown. From my perspective as a nobody, I
was always prepared for immediate rejection.
But hadn’t I come to this school because I was looking for something
other than routine?
“Wow. Everyone looks so serious,” said Satou. “They’re really
studying.”
“The library’s a pretty normal place to study, actually,” Horikita
replied, appearing out of nowhere.
I regained my composure and cleared my mind. I wanted to get
through this study session.
“Okay, you guys,” Horikita said to Ike and Yamauchi. “No commotion
tonight, okay? Next time you make a scene, there’s a chance they’ll kick you
out of the library.”
“Y-yeah, we know already. Sheesh.”
Horikita went to secure us seats. Even though more than half the chairs
were vacant, that didn’t necessarily mean that they were free. It was an
unspoken rule that the seats near the café window and next to the library
drinks station were for senior students only. In this territorial division, first-
year students were only allowed to use the noisy area near the entrance.
However, we had an additional concern this time. We wanted to avoid
being near Class C students as much as possible.
“What are you doing, Horikita?” I asked.
“If it’s the thing you’re concerned about, Ayanokouji-kun, don’t worry.
I’m already dealing with it.”
Directly ahead of us, Ichinose Honami—a Class B girl—entered the
first-year students’ area. She waved, inviting us to come talk to her. Eight
other Class B students, four guys and four girls, hung around Ichinose. I
Page 99
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
glanced over at Horikita. Judging by her expression, she wasn’t perturbed by
this. Ichinose approached us.
“Sorry to keep you waiting,” said Horikita.
“Oh no, not at all. We just got here ourselves,” said Ichinose.
“I met with Ichinose-san yesterday and suggested we form a joint study
group. Since we aren’t competing against Class B in this exam, I thought we
could help each other,” said Horikita.
Well. Every silver lining has a cloud, as they say. Ike and Yamauchi,
who’d managed to keep calm up until now, suddenly jumped.
“Ike-kun, I warned you, didn’t I?” Horikita grabbed Ike’s arm. He
locked up in terror, like a frog being glared at by a snake. Why had he and
Yamauchi suddenly become so excited? I supposed getting together with
Class B girls was appropriately stimulating.
“Ayanokouji-kun, you came, too!” said Ichinose.
“I was pretty close to failing. I might need your help,” I replied.
“Oh no, I’m sure I’m the one who needs help,” she said.
Even though the library was a quiet space, you could still hold a
conversation. Because Ichinose managed to secure us some corner seats, the
music playing throughout the library completely drowned out our low voices.
The music was Beethoven’s Symphony No. 6, “Pastoral.” It was something I
could relax to; a pretty good choice.
To think Horikita had actually formed a joint study group. Assuming
that we were able to work together with Class B, this would likely help us.
The more varied perspectives, the more creative test questions.
However, we were also taking certain risks. If any Class B students had
ties to Class C, our information might leak. Of course, Horikita already
understood that. She probably chose to bring us together because the benefits
outweighed the risks.
“Sit here, Ayanokouji-kun.” Satou urged me to sit beside her, so I did.
“Yeah, sure.”
“What’s going on, Satou? You’re sitting awfully close to Ayanokouji-
kun.”
Page 100
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“It’s only natural, isn’t it? Since we’re partners.”
I took out my textbook and notes right away. Even if it was just for
show, I probably still needed to study.
“Hey, Ayanokouji-kun, what would be the best way for me to
prepare?” asked Satou.
“You should ask Horikita,” I replied.
“But this is a good opportunity, isn’t it? You’re partners, after all. Why
don’t you take care of Satou-san, Ayanokouji-kun?” drawled Horikita.
“My test scores are only slightly different from Satou’s, so there’s
probably not that much I can teach her. Besides, I wanted to get some
tutoring myself.”
“I see. In that case, I’ll tutor you both,” said Ichinose.
“Let’s do our best together, Ayanokouji-kun,” said Satou.
“Y-yeah.” I was starting to feel pretty anxious about this study group.
“You’re always so calm, Ayanokouji-kun. You just have this really
mature vibe. What were you like back in junior high?” Satou drew closer to
me, looking into my eyes. Her uniform was slightly unbuttoned, and I caught
a glimpse of her cleavage. I wasn’t sure whether she noticed, but her
breathing was a little heavy.
“I guess pretty normal. I didn’t particularly stand out. Not very
different from now. Maybe that’s why people say I’m gloomy.” I tried to inch
away.
It was fine if Satou had a crush on me, but people were staring at us
right now, and I hated it. Ike and Yamauchi, in particular, glared
incredulously at me.
“You’re not gloomy at all, Ayanokouji-kun. I think you’re cool,” said
Satou.
“I don’t think ‘cool’ applies to me,” I said.
“Really? Well, I don’t know about other people, but that’s what I
think.”
No matter what I said, Satou interpreted it as interesting. I needed an
escape plan. “Okay, how about we find out what our weaknesses are? Did
Page 101
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
you bring your midterm with you?”
“I did.”
She took some crumpled-up test papers out of her bag. She’d scored
around fifty points across the board in every test. Although she’d answered
simple questions correctly, anything of medium difficulty or higher was
disastrous. It was actually a mystery to me how Satou managed to stay in this
school for this long.
“It’s kind of bad, isn’t it?” she asked.
“Yeah…a little. Since we seem to be about the same level, we should
study together.”
“Yes!” Satou looked incredibly excited, but I wished she wasn’t so
loud.
“Aren’t you two getting along a little too well?” asked Ike, his eyes full
of suspicion.
“We’re partners. It’s only natural, right?” replied Satou.
“Ike, why don’t you study, rather than concentrate on things you don’t
understand?” said Horikita, evidently not caring who got along with whom.
“Tch. Yeah, yeah. I know.”
Ike’s discipline. The gift that kept on giving.

Our study session ended without incident, and everyone started to
head back to the dorm.
“Aw, I’m beat!” Ike whined.
For people like Ike and Yamauchi, who couldn’t even concentrate
during normal school hours, an after-school study session was the very
definition of hell. They beamed with delight at being finally free, but Horikita
glared icily at them.
“Today’s not the end. We have another session tomorrow,” she said.
“C-come on, I know that. Isn’t it okay for me to be at least a little
happy? I worked hard!” Ike shot back as the two idiots raced out of the
library.
“Wow, Class D sure is lively. I almost wish you’d share some of that
energy with us!” said Ichinose.
“Yeah, but they’re lively about all the wrong things. To be honest, I
envy Class B,” replied Horikita.
She wasn’t mistaken to feel that way. The Class B students were more
focused than Class D; they were calm and composed, and cooperated with
one another.
“Goodbye,” Kushida said to Ichinose. “Horikita-san, goodbye to you,
too.”
“Yeah, goodbye,” Horikita replied.
Kushida left without incident, a few other girls in tow. So, she was
playing it cool for now. It seemed that both she and Horikita were checking
each other out.
“Ichinose-san, can I ask you a few questions?” asked Horikita.
“Hmm? What kind of questions?”
“I’d prefer it if this was just between you and me. It’ll only take a few
minutes,” said Horikita.
Page 103
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“A few minutes? All right. Sorry, everybody, but could you please wait
for me in the hall?” asked Ichinose.
“Should I stay?” I asked.
“It doesn’t matter either way,” said Horikita.
I thought she was being sarcastic, for a moment, but then realized she
was probably employing reverse psychology to make me stick around.
“What did you want to talk about?” asked Ichinose.
It felt a little strange that the pair of them were alone like this. Ichinose
and Horikita, two people with opposite personalities, stood shoulder to
shoulder.
“Ichinose-san, if a friend or an ally were in trouble, you’d help them.
Right?” asked Horikita.
“Um, yeah? Isn’t that only natural?” replied Ichinose.
“Mm-hmm. And it’s very kind of Class B to help us with these study
sessions. So, if someone reached out to you for help, you’d offer them a
hand. Right, Ichinose-san?” asked Horikita.
“Of course,” Ichinose answered immediately. There was no indecision.
“Then, do you have clear criteria for determining who is and isn’t your
friend?” Maybe Horikita’s conflict with Kushida prompted these questions.
“Hmm. What do you mean?”
“Well, would you be unconditionally willing to help someone, as long
as they were from Class B? Even if that student didn’t contribute much to the
class?”
“No matter how the other person acted, I’d be on Class B’s side. If
someone were in trouble, I’d definitely try to help.”
“Maybe this is a silly question, after all,” said Horikita. “Well, let me
ask you another silly question. Let’s suppose someone in Class B hated you.
Would you be able to like that person? Or would you end up hating them in
return?”
“Hmm. I’m not sure. If they really hated me, my best option would be
to avoid contact as much as possible, to keep them from disliking me even
more,” said Ichinose.

“And if that person were in trouble, what would you do?”
“Help them,” said Ichinose immediately. “Even if they really hated me,
I’m always Class B’s ally.”
“Class B seems extremely important to you,” said Horikita.
“Yes. They’re all good kids. I admit that, at first, I was sad I wasn’t in
Class A. But now, I think I’m in the best class. Don’t you feel the same,
Horikita?”
“Well…home is where you make it, I suppose. Class D isn’t too bad,”
said Horikita.
“Oh?” I muttered.
“What, Ayanokouji-kun? Have something to add?” Horikita glared at
me.
“Sorry to insert myself into your conversation, but can I ask you
something, Ichinose?” I said.
“Sure.”
“I understand that your classmates are unconditional allies. I do think
it’s necessary to be friends with everyone in your boat, so to speak. However,
are the Class A, C, and D students your friends?”
“Well, you and Horikita-san are dear friends to me, Ayanokouji-kun.”
“Then what if we’re in trouble? What if we came to you, begging you
to lend us a million points?” I asked.
“If there were a good reason, I’d help. The amount doesn’t matter,”
said Ichinose.
“Sheesh. Your generosity knows no bounds. You’ll really help
anyone?”
“Ideally, yes, but I know it’s not always that simple. There’s a limit to
how much I can do myself. If Ryuuen-kun were in trouble, I couldn’t help
him like I help others. But if it’s within my power, I’ll help,” said Ichinose.
“As long as you’re my friend, a problem’s nature or intensity doesn’t matter.”
“Although I appreciate that, I have my doubts. So, if I came crying to
you, begging for help…?”
Page 105
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“I’d welcome you with open arms.”
“In that case…what would you do if Kanzaki-kun and I had the same
problem?” Horikita asked.
“You mean if I had to pick one of you?” Ichinose was at a complete
loss. “Sorry. I don’t know how to answer that. In a hypothetical scenario like
that, no matter who I helped, I’d hurt someone else.”
That was just like Ichinose. Horikita seemed both genuinely surprised
and impressed.
“I don’t believe purely good people exist. Humans are crafty animals
who want their virtues rewarded,” said Horikita. “But after hearing what you
said… Maybe there really are good people in this world.”
Ichinose seemed taken aback. “You’re giving me far too much credit,
Horikita-san.”
She’d been honest and straightforward with us so far, but now, her eyes
darted around the room.
“Well, I at least think you’re a better person than anyone I’ve ever
met,” said Horikita.
“I’m really not so wonderful,” replied Ichinose. She couldn’t even look
Horikita in the face.
“Really, it’s not a big deal.” Horikita obviously noticed Ichinose’s
strange reaction. “I’m sorry. Perhaps I went a little overboard. I didn’t mean
to make you uncomfortable.”
“It’s okay. You didn’t really make me uncomfortable.” Still, Ichinose
was clearly shaken. “Is that all you wanted to talk about? Chihiro-chan and
the others are waiting on me. Can we call it a day?”
“Thank you for answering my silly questions,” said Horikita.
“No problem. Well, I’ll see you tomorrow,” replied Ichinose.
After she left, Horikita and I, a few third-year students, and the library
staff were all that remained.
“Let’s head back,” said Horikita. “I still have things to do.”
“What are you going to do about Kushida? It sounds like you came up
with something,” I said. Horikita probably didn’t like being asked that
Page 106
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
question over and over, but I had to make sure.
“She’s special. I’ll have to be extra careful,” said Horikita.
“Special?”
“I’ve been thinking about several things. About the kind of life
Kushida Kikyou would’ve had at this school had I not enrolled here.
Everyone in class would’ve trusted and leaned upon her. She could have
studied and played sports without any concerns. She would’ve carried on like
that until graduation. However, my presence took that easy future from her.
She worked with an enemy, Ryuuen-kun, in a desperate bid to drive me out.
She didn’t hesitate to attack her own class. Of course, that isn’t my fault. It’s
just bad luck that we ended up at the same school.”
“I have a suggestion,” I told Horikita.
“What kind of suggestion?”
“I believe I found the puzzle piece you’ll need to reconcile with
Kushida.”
“What do you mean?”
“Would you agree that Ichinose is a good person?”
“Yes. I wouldn’t doubt it, even if I caught wind of unpleasant rumors
about her,” said Horikita.
“So, why not get a good person to mediate between you two? Frankly,
I think nothing will come from a one-on-one conversation with Kushida. She
would never reveal her true nature to anyone in Class D.”
“Maybe not… But even so, I don’t think it’s right to have Ichinose
mediate,” said Horikita.
“I don’t think this’ll resolve everything. I’m just saying it’s a step in
the right direction. Right now, you and Kushida aren’t even on good enough
terms to talk. If Ichinose mediated, you could probably have an actual
conversation.”
In fact, Ichinose was just the first step in resolving this problem. More
puzzle pieces were yet to come.
Horikita shook her head. “I can’t accept that. I’m going to settle things
with Kushida myself.”

That didn’t sound like a terribly good idea.

Kushida was waiting for us. When she saw Horikita and me, she
gave a small wave and smiled brightly.
“Kushida-san. Sorry to have kept you waiting,” Horikita said.
“It’s all right. There’s still a little time left before we were scheduled to
meet. What were you talking about with Honami-chan?” asked Kushida.
“Nothing important.”
“I’d still like to know. Is it something you can tell me?” Kushida’s tone
of voice and smile remained unchanged, but the tension rose.
“Sure. After all, it’s completely unrelated to you,” said Horikita. “I
asked her how I could talk to people equally, without showing distinction or
favoritism.”
“Oh?”
“I’m not going to lie. I was asking about you, Kushida-san,” said
Horikita.
“Listen here, Horikita-san. While you and I may not get along, I’d
much rather talk about this without Ayanokouji-kun,” said Kushida. “Or
could it be…that Ayanokouji-kun and Ichinose-san now know something?”
She glared at us. Horikita, however, didn’t flinch.
“Sorry, Ayanokouji-kun, but could you head back without me?” said
Horikita.
“Looks like I’m getting in the way,” I muttered.
I left them and made my way toward the exit. After changing my
shoes, I headed to the dormitory. En route, I got a call from Horikita and
answered it.
I heard Horikita’s muffled voice through the phone’s speaker. “We
attended the same junior high. Because I know about your past, you want to
get me expelled. Do I have the facts correct?”
Apparently, Horikita called me with her phone in her pocket. She was
Page 109
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
letting me listen in.
“Well, this is certainly sudden. Why bring up the past? I don’t like
talking about that.”
“I don’t like it, either. But we can’t avoid it.”
“Well, we’ve rarely had the chance to be alone like this. But you’re
certainly right—I do want you to disappear from this school, Horikita-san.
And, yes, it’s because we were in junior high together, and you know about
that incident.”
“Although it’s true that I heard about an incident, I didn’t care. I
didn’t have any friends back then, anyway. All I heard were rumors. I don’t
know what the truth really is.”
“But there’s no guarantee you don’t know, is there?”
“You’re right. That’s why you can’t let it go. No matter how much I
deny it, you can’t be sure I’m not lying. I imagine that you’d like to have me
kicked out of school because you can’t forgive me for knowing that there was
an incident at all.”
Kushida didn’t deny it.
“How about we place a bet, Kushida-san?”
“A bet? What are you talking about?”
I couldn’t imagine that this was something Horikita just came up with
on the fly. She’d most likely planned it.
“You don’t like that I’m here. I can’t do anything about that, right?”
“Right. As long as you’re here, Horikita-san, I can’t rest easy.”
“But we’re both in Class D. If we don’t work together, we can’t
advance to Class A.”
“Actually, I think expelling you will solve the problem.”
“Do you plan on dropping out, too?”
“Of course not. Only you’ll drop out, Horikita-san.”
While their voices were muffled, both of them sounded very calm.
“I have no intention of dropping out,” said Horikita.
Page 110
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Then there’s nothing we can do. I don’t think we can get along.”
“You might be right about that. I’ve been trying to come up with a way
we can coexist. But I concluded that, no matter what I do, it’s impossible.”
“I think so too, Horikita-san. This won’t be over until one of us is
gone.”
“We aren’t children. We can’t just fight. But you don’t trust me.”
There was a brief silence. Then Kushida spoke.
“What did you mean when you said ‘place a bet’?”
“If I score higher than you on the upcoming final exam, you’ll
cooperate with me from now on without any hostility. I’m not expecting us to
be best friends; I just want you to stop trying to hurt me. That’s all.”
“That’s ridiculous, Horikita-san. I didn’t beat your midterm score.
Even if we based this bet on our total scores, it would still be hard for me to
win. Besides, I’d gain nothing from winning.”
“Yes. That’s true. So…” Horikita’s voice was barely above a whisper
now. “Let’s determine the winner based on one of the eight subjects. You’re
free to choose whichever subject you’re best in. If your score is higher than
mine, I’ll drop out of school. That’s my offer.”
I couldn’t believe this. Horikita was taking a huge gamble, and she
gave Kushida rather favorable conditions to boot by allowing her to choose
her best subject. If Kushida lost, she wouldn’t need to drop out. She’d just
have to stop getting in Horikita’s way. On the other hand, if Kushida won,
Horikita was done for.
“But this is just a verbal agreement, Horikita-san. If you lose, you
could act like the bet never happened. Of course, I might not uphold my part
of the arrangement, either. Can we both really trust what the other person
says?”
“To make things official, I intend to involve a reliable witness.”
“A reliable witness?”
“If you would, please…niisan.”
“Wha—?!”
Kushida seemed honestly shocked. I was, too. Horikita was so deadly
Page 111
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
serious about this agreement, she’d brought her older brother to act as
witness.
“I’m terribly sorry to ask this of you, niisan. But I absolutely need your
help.”
That’s right. She’d actually summoned Horikita Manabu, the former
student council president and her older brother, to the spot.
“It’s been a long time, Kushida,” I heard him say. “Do you remember
me?”
“I don’t forget people.”
The Horikita siblings had attended the same junior high as Kushida.
But Horikita’s older brother graduated before the incident involving Kushida
happened, so he couldn’t know that she’d caused it.
“I trust my brother the most in this school. You can trust him as well,
Kushida-san. Don’t worry, I didn’t tell him any details.”
“I was called to act as witness, nothing more. I’m not interested in
anything else.”
“Are you okay with this, Horikita-senpai? If your little sister loses,
then—”
“She made the bet. It has nothing to do with me.”
“I also swear that I won’t say a word to anyone if I lose, Kushida-san.
I’d bring shame on my brother’s name if I went around breaking promises. I
would never do that.”
The deal couldn’t possibly get any better for Kushida.
“You’re serious, aren’t you, Horikita-san?”
“I’m not the kind to wait around for people to strike.”
“Fine. I accept your challenge. And I’m all right with the terms of the
bet. I choose mathematics. Can I assume that if we end up getting the same
score, neither one of us wins?”
Horikita must have nodded. They’d agreed to terms right in front of
Horikita’s brother. There was no way to back out now.
“I will fulfill my role as witness. Should either of you violate the bet,
Page 112
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
you’d best be prepared for the consequences.”
Even after retiring as student council president, Horikita’s brother still
held a great deal of authority. Kushida would honor the arrangement until he
graduated, at the very least.
“Thank you very much, niisan.”
The conversation went silent. Kushida and Horikita were probably
waiting for Horikita’s brother to leave.
“I’m looking forward to the final exam, Horikita-san.”
“Let’s give it everything we’ve got. Both of us.”
“Yes. Give my regards to Ayanokouji-kun, too.”
“Why?”
“Because you told him, didn’t you? About my past.”
“That’s—”
“Ah, you don’t really need to answer that. I don’t trust you, Horikita-
san, so it doesn’t matter. I won’t violate our bet’s terms, so you can relax.
Besides, Ayanokouji-kun has seen a little of my bad side.”
I felt Horikita’s panic through the phone. “Yes. I told Ayanokouji-kun.”
“I knew it. By the way, are you using your phone right now? You see,
I’ve tried calling you over and over for the last few minutes, Horikita-san, but
it seems like you’ve been on a call.”
It wasn’t just intuition. Kushida had some guts.
“Care to join us, Ayanokouji-kun?”
It was probably best for me to obey.
Page 113
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com

I headed back to Kushida and Horikita.
“Yoo-hoo!” said Kushida. Although she had a cheery expression, I
couldn’t tell what her true feelings were.
“You really got me, Kushida-san. You’re incredible,” said Horikita.
“Thank you. But, really, I’m merely observant,” replied Kushida.
“Why did you call for Ayanokouji-kun?” Horikita asked. “I thought
our conversation was over. If you’re angry that I had him listen in, just say
so.”
“I’m not particularly displeased. It’s just that I’d rather speak to you
both face-to-face. I was wondering whether you would mind me adding
another condition to the bet,” said Kushida.
“A condition?”
“If I beat your score, Horikita-san, I want Ayanokouji-kun to drop out,
too.”
I’d thought that Kushida might propose this.
“No,” replied Horikita.
“I want to make everyone who knows about my past disappear. Even if
you’re no longer here, Horikita-san, if Ayanokouji-kun remains, so will my
troubles.”
“Maybe. But this is my gamble, so I can’t involve him.”
“Well, that’s too bad. I could’ve killed two birds with one stone.”
“So, you want me expelled too, huh?” I asked.
“Ha ha ha! There’s no need to look so disappointed. It’s not your fault,
Ayanokouji-kun. It’s just bad luck that you learned about my true nature.”
“There’s no problem if he doesn’t tell anyone, though,” said Horikita.
“If that were all it took, Horikita-san, you wouldn’t have challenged
me to this bet.”
Page 114
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Well, you’re vital to Class D, after all.”
“You’ve changed. You wouldn’t have said that before.”
“If I’m always fighting with my peers, then I’ll never make it to the
higher classes. I’ll be stuck in a vicious circle,” said Horikita.
Had the two of them ever talked this openly before? Yet they couldn’t
see eye to eye. Such a tragic fate. If they hadn’t attended the same junior
high, Kushida probably would have cooperated with Horikita. In that case,
Kushida would’ve influenced the classmates Hirata and Karuizawa couldn’t
reach, and Class D might have united much sooner.
“Can I join this wager? I bet that Horikita will win,” I said.
“Wait a minute,” said Horikita. “What are you saying, Ayanokouji-
kun? This has nothing to do with you.”
“It started out that way. But now it does have something to do with me.
Besides, I eavesdropped on your conversation.”
Even if Horikita won the bet and was temporarily free from Kushida’s
attacks, Kushida could just focus her offensive on me instead. If I protected
myself now, it would make things easier in the long run.
“I’d be happy to have you join,” said Kushida.
“But I also have a condition.”
“Hmm?”
“I want you to tell me the specifics of this junior high incident.” I was
entering dangerous territory.
“That’s—”
I didn’t hold back. If I acted swiftly now, I could secure an advantage.
“It’s my right to ask for this much. I don’t know any details, and yet you’re
trying to get me expelled. You’re acting on the belief that Horikita knows
about the incident, right? So, just explain it to us right now. As long as you
beat Horikita on the test, the school will kick us both out, and you won’t have
to worry.”
“I’m not interested in her past,” said Horikita.
“Well, I am. I can’t accept that Kushida’s threatening my whole life
here on a selfish whim,” I replied.
Page 115
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“It’s true that you’re now involved, Ayanokouji-kun. I can’t deny that.
If Horikita-san really hasn’t told you the details, I understand your feelings.
But if I do tell you, there’ll be no turning back. Understand?” asked Kushida.
“Haven’t I already passed the point of no return?” I asked. Kushida had
designated me her enemy.
“Yes. You’re way past it.”
“In that case, tell me why it’s worth taking this gamble.”
Horikita probably wondered why I was going this far—why I would
risk being expelled. Her eyes said as much, but she wouldn’t question
anything in front of Kushida.
Sorry, but I can’t do what you want, Horikita. I finally have the chance
to expose Kushida Kikyou’s past.
“Ayanokouji-kun, is there something that you’re the best at? Better
than anyone else?” asked Kushida.
“I’m just an average person. What you’d call a jack of all trades,
master of none. If I had to pick something, I guess I’m a little faster than
average.”
“Then I wonder if you can understand what I’m feeling. Don’t you
think that the best thing in the world is feeling valued in some special way?
When you get the highest score on a test, or win first place in a race,
everyone’s eyes are on you. You know those moments when people shower
you with attention?” asked Kushida.
Of course I understood. People naturally desired the approval of others.
Working hard enough to earn praise for accomplishments was fundamental to
how human society functioned.
“I think that I’m probably addicted to that feeling,” Kushida said.
“More so than normal people. I can’t help wanting to show off. I can’t help
wanting to stand out. I can’t help wanting to be praised. When I am, I truly
feel how wonderful it is to be alive. But I know my own limits. No matter
how hard I try, I won’t be number one in school or in sports—and coming
second or third won’t satisfy my cravings. So, I thought I’d do something that
no one else could—be nicer and kinder than everyone else.”
That was the root of Kushida’s kindness? It was better to be a
Page 116
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
genuinely kind, helpful person who made mistakes than someone two-faced
who just bragged about being perfectly good. A kind but flawed individual
was more honest than a saintly liar.
“Thanks to that, I became popular with both boys and girls. I took
pleasure in being trusted and relied upon. Elementary school and junior high
were really fun,” said Kushida.
“Isn’t it agonizing, though? Doing things that you don’t want to do? If
it were me, I couldn’t take it. I think I’d break down,” said Horikita.
“Of course it’s agonizing. Day after day, I’m under so much stress I
feel like I’m going to go bald. I’ve pulled my hair out and vomited from
anxiety. But I can’t let anyone see that side of me. That’s why I continued to
endure, and endure, and endure,” said Kushida.
How had she kept this act up for so long?
“My blog saved me. It was the only place where I dumped out this
hidden stress. I could tell it all my most painful secrets. Of course, I posted
everything anonymously, you know? But I wrote the facts just as they were,
and it made me so happy when I received encouragement from people I
didn’t even know. Then, one day, a classmate discovered my blog. Even
though I hadn’t named anyone, it was clear my posts were all based on real
events.”
“That’s how this incident started?”
“The next day, my posts were shared with the entire class. Everyone
condemned me. I’d helped them so much, and yet they all turned on me.
Selfish, right? The boy who’d told me that he liked me actually shoved me. It
was understandable, though, since I’d posted that his romantic confession
grossed me out and I wanted him to die. One girl I’d comforted after she was
dumped even kicked my desk. I’d posted in detail about why she was
dumped and made fun of her. Over thirty students decided I was their mortal
enemy that day.”
“So, how did you make it through? Violence? Or lies?” That was the
mystery that Horikita and I still didn’t know the answer to.
“Neither. All I did was tell the truth. I revealed all my classmates’
secrets. Who hated who, who thought who was a disgusting creep. I exposed
truths I hadn’t even written on my blog.”
Page 117
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Of course. Truth was a weapon that you could only obtain through
trust. Horikita and I didn’t have that. Although truth might seem harmless, it
was actually a powerful double-edged sword, only usable at the cost of more
trust.
“At that point, my classmates stopped being angry at me and started
hating each other. The boys got into fistfights, the girls pulled each other’s
hair and shoved each other over. The entire classroom descended into
complete chaos. It was honestly incredible.”
“So, that’s how it happened.”
Page 118
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Page 119
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Because of everything I exposed, the class could no longer function.
The school rebuked me, but my blog was anonymous, and all I technically
did was tell my classmates the truth.” Kushida spoke indifferently, but every
word she uttered carried weight. “I still don’t know that much about my
fellow Class D students. However, I know enough to destroy a few people.
That’s my only weapon.”
A threat. If we told anyone about her, we should prepare for the
consequences. If Kushida felt it was necessary, she would tear a rift in Class
D right after we’d finally started bringing everyone together. If that
happened, the harmony we’d established would disappear.
“It was a mistake to use the internet to vent my feelings. Everything
you put up there is saved forever. That’s why I stopped blogging. Now, I
blow off steam by saying what’s on my mind out loud when I’m alone.”
Like the first time I’d seen that other side of her.
“Do you want to remain as you are right now?” I asked.
“This is my reason for being. More than I love anything else in the
world, I love everyone respecting and noticing me. When people trust me
with their secrets, I feel joy that surpasses my wildest imaginings.”
Knowing the anxiety, suffering, embarrassment, and hopes that people
held deep within their hearts was Kushida’s forbidden fruit.
“Boring, isn’t it? But to me, it’s everything.” Kushida’s smile
disappeared. Now that she’d told us about her past, we became true enemies
in her eyes. From this point onward, she wouldn’t show us the slightest
compassion. “Don’t forget. If I score higher in math, both you and
Ayanokouji-kun will drop out.”
“Yes,” said Horikita.
And that was that. Satisfied, Kushida left to return to her dorm.
I turned to Horikita. “Are you sure about this? Kushida’s involved with
Ryuuen.”
“If you knew it was dangerous, why did you join? Because you believe
I won’t lose?” Horikita countered.
“Well, yeah.” Truthfully, I went along with the bet because I had some
Page 120
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
ideas of my own.
“Even though Kushida might be able to help Ryuuen-kun, I really have
to wonder whether it’ll come to that,” said Horikita.
“What do you mean?”
“Do you think that Ryuuen-kun really wants me to drop out?” she
asked.
“It’s doubtful.”
Ryuuen wanted to entrap Horikita, but he wasn’t trying to get her
kicked out of school. He hoped to see her brought low, and her expulsion
would end those aspirations. Besides, would he really let Horikita go without
finding out who was working with her in secret? Would he let her get
expelled without exposing me first?
“But what if Kushida lies to get the questions from him? She might say
that she wants to improve her personal score, and keep our bet’s details
secret,” I said.
“Ryuuen-kun would see through something like that. If Kushida-san
asked for the math answers, he’d want to know why,” said Horikita.
“You’re probably right. But this is dangerous.”
“There’ll always be danger. It helps to have things you’re willing to
put on the line.”
“There’s no turning back from this. We definitely need to win.”
“Of course.”
Horikita was making her biggest gamble yet.

Chapter 6:
The Ayanokouji Group’s Formation
 
Time flew by, and soon it was time for Yukimura’s fifth study
session with Miyake and Hasebe. We’d held the prior sessions at Pallet, but
we decided to gather at the café inside Keyaki Mall today. We anticipated
that Pallet would be exceptionally crowded, since all the clubs had ceased
activities in order for the students to focus on the final.
“Wow, it’s even noisier than I imagined,” said Yukimura.
He looked overwhelmed by the number of students in the café. We
managed to secure seats, but Pallet was practically at full capacity. It was
packed with students from all grades sitting in their own study groups.
Despite how focused everyone was on cramming, the library would definitely
have been quieter.
“We should’ve met in the library,” said Yukimura, echoing my
thoughts. “Or in my room.”
“No way. It’s easier to do it here. Right, Miyacchi?” asked Hasebe.
“Yeah. Archery club is already quiet and tense enough,” replied
Miyake.
No one wanted to be stuck in a stuffy room. The modern method was
to study while chatting with friends. Degenerative evolution.
“Well, you’re the ones who’ll be studying. If you say that you can
concentrate, then I believe you. Here, I prepared some material,” said
Yukimura.
He handed Hasebe and Miyake notebooks full of questions on the
humanities. The two accepted the material indifferently. The questions were
lined up closely, like food stalls packed together at a festival with a fireworks
display. Yukimura looked all keyed up. These problems he’d created
wouldn’t be easy to solve.
“Whoa. You really went overboard. You’re merciless, Yukimuu!” said
Hasebe. Since she didn’t exactly like studying, let alone studying her weakest
Page 123
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
subject, I was sure this was torture for her. Miyake, meanwhile, looked as
though he was about to vomit. He kept his hands over his stomach while he
perused the notebook.
“How can you be so terrified before you even start?” asked Yukimura.
“It’s just… There are clearly way more questions here than last time,
and they look harder.”
“That’s a mediocre student’s mindset. Think about what you can do
first, and challenge yourself,” said Yukimura.
“In that case, are the questions simpler than last time?” Hasebe asked.
“Of course not.”
“Yeah, I knew they’d be tough.”
Honestly, the problems Yukimura had come up with really were
brilliant. He could probably become a real teacher someday if he tried. He
chided students, but never gave up on them, and never raised his voice or lost
his patience when they didn’t understand something. Had Yukimura, like
Horikita, matured? It was incredible.
In the first semester, Horikita and Yukimura had both insisted they
were placed in Class D by mistake, as both were superior students. That felt
like such a long time ago.
“Come on, Hasebe.” Miyake understood that there was no point in
grumbling.
“Wow, you’re getting pretty gung-ho there, Miyacchi. What’s up with
you? Is your blood boiling?” she asked.
“I finally got a break from club stuff, but I don’t want to spend all my
free time studying. Can I head back after I finish?” Miyake asked Yukimura.
“Of course.”
Yukimura and Horikita had different teaching methods. While Horikita
designated a fixed amount of time for studying, Yukimura was more flexible.
His sessions lasted until the students got through all the material, and could
therefore finish earlier or later than expected. The method’s effectiveness
depended on who Yukimura tutored—if he tried this with lackadaisical
students like Ike, for instance, it would be a bust. They’d probably just
Page 124
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
answer without thinking so they could finish early and escape.
“If you don’t have any free time, why not quit the club?” asked
Hasebe.
“I want to be in the club. I just also want free time,” replied Miyake.
“Wow, selfish.”
It seemed that Yukimura really had a positive impact on them both. I
didn’t think they had any remaining doubts about his method’s effectiveness.
“All right, Ayanokouji. Starting today, I’ll have you do these, too.”
“Huh…?”
“You get good enough grades, but your partner is Satou. You’ll need to
prepare and review thoroughly so you don’t both get kicked out,” said
Yukimura.
“No, I—”
“Just do it, Ayanokouji-kun. Let’s all die together,” said Hasebe,
dipping her head low so her hair hung down. She grabbed my hand, as if she
were a vengeful spirit trying to drag me into a well.
“Welcoooome,” she moaned.
A shiver ran up my spine as I was swallowed by the terrible darkness
of the humanities questions.

“That reminds me. There’s a guy named Yoshimoto-kun in Class C,
right? Do you know him, Miyacchi?”
“Yoshimoto Kousetsu? Yeah, he’s in the archery club.”
“I heard that he started going out with a second-year. You know about
that?” Hasebe, tired of studying, started to gossip.
“Nope. But, come to think of it, he’s been in a real hurry to leave as
soon as club ends lately. That must be why.”
If you were an adult in your thirties, an age difference of a year or two
didn’t matter much. For high school students, though, trying to date someone
even one grade above you was tricky. At least, I was fairly sure that was how
things worked.
“It seems as if Yoshimoto-kun’s really into it. He said they’re going to
get married someday. Jeez, guys are morons, aren’t they?” Hasebe and
Miyake’s conversation completely derailed their focus.
“Talk about the future later. First, get your work done,” said Yukimura.
“I know, I know. We’re just taking a short break,” said Hasebe. She
didn’t seem to care what Yukimura said.
“Yes. Very short.”
“Wow, okay, I feel those sarcastic vibes. I’m gonna get a refill.”
“You’re having even more sugar? Your coffee’s so ridiculously sweet,
I’m shocked you can drink it,” said Miyake.
“Well, I struggle to understand why anyone would drink their coffee
black.” Hasebe started to get up, but stumbled slightly over the backpack
she’d placed at her feet. “Whoa!”
She dropped her empty cup. My eyes followed it as it rolled along the
ground, until it stopped rolling by a particular student’s feet.
“Ah, sorr—” Hasebe started to apologize. However, the student’s foot
crushed the cup.
Page 126
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“My, you seem to be enjoying yourselves. Mind if we join?” asked
Ryuuen.
“What are you…?” Hasebe glared at the Class C guys. An
understandable reaction. Ryuuen had a smug grin on his face. Ishizaki,
Komiya, and Kondou, the evergreen trio of goons, stood behind him.
There was also one girl with them whom we hadn’t seen before. She
stood next to Ishizaki, and appeared extremely calm.
“Hey!” said Hasebe. “Why’d you stomp on my cup like that?”
“It rolled up to my feet, so I thought you were throwing it away. I
stomped it to save you the trouble,” said Ryuuen.
He kicked the crushed cup back toward Hasebe, laughing. A little of
the remaining liquid splashed onto the ground.
Miyake slowly stood. “Hey, Ryuuen. Knock it off.”
“Oh? And whom exactly do you think you’re speaking to, buddy?”
Ishizaki grabbed Miyake by his collar.
“I wasn’t talking to you. Lackeys should mind their own business,
Ishizaki,” said Miyake, shaking off his grip.
“Bastard!” shouted Ishizaki, attracting other patrons’ attention.
Surprisingly, that outburst enraged Ryuuen most of all. “Shut up. Are
you really trying to throw down, Ishizaki?”
“S-sorry. Miyake was getting full of himself, so I—”
“Reckless idiots amuse me, but I need you to behave yourself for
now.”
“Yes…”
Ryuuen was right to rein in Ishizaki. Senior students, store clerks, and
several surveillance cameras surrounded us. Nothing went unseen here, and if
Class C started trouble, they would pay for it.
“I have no business with you. I’m interested in those two,” said
Ryuuen to Miyake, glancing at Yukimura and me. “Did you receive my
gift?”
Naturally, Yukimura was bewildered. “What in the world are you
Page 127
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
talking about?”
Ryuuen looked to me. Without a doubt, the “gift” was the email he’d
sent me the other day, the one that said, What are you?
“Who knows?” I feigned ignorance. Ryuuen’s methods were heavy-
handed. I wouldn’t dig my own grave by answering his questions.
“So, how about it? Did you catch something, Hiyori?” Ryuuen glanced
at the girl with him.
“I can’t say anything at this stage,” she replied.
A lot of the students working under Ryuuen were terrified of him, but
this Hiyori was completely calm. She kept looking back and forth between
Yukimura and me. What in the world was Ryuuen planning?
“Both their faces are weak. I’ll probably forget them immediately,” she
added.
“Heh heh, come now. These are our future friends, after all.”
“Yukimura-san, Ayanokouji-kun, Kouenji-kun. Who was the other
guy?” she asked.
“It was Hirata.”
“Yes, that’s right. Hirata-san. Why are faces and names so hard to
remember?” Hiyori was a complete mystery. I was concerned that Ishizaki
was being this polite around her.
“It looks like the only one you’ll remember is Kouenji.”
“Well, he’s unique,” she replied.
So, Ryuuen suspected Hirata and Kouenji as well. Though Kouenji was
far from a team player, it was only natural that Ryuuen was cautious of his
talent. That said, I had a hunch that Ryuuen would never consider Kouenji a
suspect if he knew what a natural-born weirdo Kouenji really was.
“What the hell do you want, Ryuuen?” asked Miyake aggressively.
“We’re busy. If you’ve got something to say, say it.”
“Nothing. I just came to say hello. But I’ll tell you something. We’ll be
seeing you again real soon,” said Ryuuen.
“What does that mean?”
Page 128
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Ignoring Miyake, Ryuuen left with his lackeys in tow. At his departure,
the café immediately grew lively again.
However, Hiyori remained, still watching us. We couldn’t concentrate
under these circumstances.
Page 129
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Page 130
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Hasebe spoke up. “What is it? You’re getting in the way of our
studies,” she grumbled.
“Just wait,” replied Hiyori.
“Huh? Look, I’m telling you that you’re distracting us, so just go away.
Understand?” said Hasebe, in a bad mood now that Ryuuen had crushed her
cup.
Hiyori responded with an odd smile. She grabbed her bag and walked
over to the cash register.
“What was that about?” asked Hasebe.
“Who knows? I don’t want to know,” said Yukimura.
“That’s Shiina Hiyori from Class C. I’ve seen her before,” said
Miyake.
Hiyori placed an order at the register, then returned with two cups.
“Please accept this,” she said.
“What are you up to?” asked Hasebe.
“It’s quite all right. You needn’t be so wary of me. Please allow me to
apologize on Class C’s behalf. I went ahead and took the liberty of adding
some sugar. Do you mind?” said Hiyori.
“Adding some…hmm? Wow, this is tasty! It’s exactly the same as
what I was just drinking!” exclaimed Hasebe.
“I noticed that a lot of sugar had collected at the bottom of the cup
Ryuuen crushed, so I assumed that you liked your coffee sweet. I’m glad to
see I wasn’t mistaken,” said Hiyori.
“It tastes like you put in the exact amount of sugar I did. Coincidence?”
asked Hasebe.
“I used the amount of undissolved sugar to estimate how much you put
in at first,” replied Hiyori.
“Huuuuh?! You can do that?!”
“Despite how I may look, I’m actually quite perceptive.” Hiyori fixed
her gaze on Yukimura, then me, and then Miyake. “You’re holding a study
session, aren’t you?”
Page 131
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Girls like you just totally sap my energy,” grumbled Hasebe.
Yukimura hurriedly closed everyone’s notebooks.
“Do you happen to think that I’m a spy?” asked Hiyori.
“We definitely think you’re a spy.”
“I wouldn’t, if I were you. I generally keep my distance from Ryuuen-
kun.”
“Wait a minute. Didn’t Ryuuen-kun just call you by your first name?”
“I insisted that he let me accompany them to see you. Class D interests
me.”
The rest of the study group tilted their heads in apparent confusion,
unable to understand Hiyori’s words or intentions. I imitated them, cocking
my head to the right as I pretended that I didn’t realize what was going on,
either.
“You don’t know?” asked Hiyori. “It’s all anyone in Class C talks
about right now. They say a master tactician’s hiding in Class D, disguising
his or her true identity. Apparently, this tactician has contributed significantly
to Class D’s successes, from the island test to the cruise ship and sports
festival. You really don’t know?”
Hasebe, Yukimura, and Miyake almost had question marks floating
above their heads. “I honestly have no clue what you’re talking about,” said
Yukimura. “Do you mean Horikita?”
“Yeah. The only person I can think of is Horikita-san,” Miyake agreed.
“It’s not Horikita Suzune-san,” said Hiyori flatly. “Ayanokouji-san,
you spend a great deal of time with Horikita-san, right?”
“Not so much recently, but I’ve probably spent more time with her
than with others,” I replied.
“You do sit right next to her, don’t you?”
Hasebe and Miyake backed me up. “But there’s no one smarter than
Horikita-san is.”
“Yeah. She comes up with all Class D’s strategies.”
It was important that I appeared like a typical Class D student right
now.
Page 132
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“I see,” said Hiyori. “You all feel the same, is that it?”
“Can you please stop interrupting our study session?” muttered
Yukimura.
“I apologize. I’m disturbing your studies, aren’t I?”
“Yes, you’re exactly right. You are,” said Yukimura.
“You don’t have to be so harsh, Yukimuu,” Hasebe said.
“If you’re fine with failing and getting kicked out of school, go ahead
and chat with her. I’ll head back,” said Yukimura.
“I-I’m sorry, really. Please forgive me. I’d like you to keep tutoring
me,” said Hasebe. She bowed her head.
Hiyori stood up from her seat, looking apologetic. “I’m very sorry.
You’re right that it’d be a real risk not to take this test seriously,” she said.
Was that a dig at the bad students? Although I got the impression that
Hiyori was naturally rather aloof, I wasn’t certain whether she could be
trusted or not.
“Let’s talk about that stuff after the final exam’s over.” Hiyori picked
up her cup and made to go.
“Thank you for the coffee. It was yummy,” said Hasebe.
“No problem at all. Goodbye,” said Hiyori.
With that, she left alone after showing up with Ryuuen. She might have
come here as part of Ryuuen’s plan to trap me, but I couldn’t be too careful. I
decided to investigate Hiyori.

Since we all lived in the same dormitory, we walked back together.
Fiddling with his phone, Yukimura recorded today’s progress.
“It’s been a long time since I studied this hard!” Hasebe said. “Six
hours in class, plus another two hours afterward, right? There’s gotta be, like,
almost no students in the world who have to study that much, huh?”
“Those Class C students interrupted us and wasted our time, though,”
said Miyake.
“But we didn’t let them throw us off. We studied hard today!” replied
Hasebe.
An irritated look flashed across Yukimura’s face at their happy chatter.
“You’ve got to be joking. When university entrance exams begin, you’ll need
to study for at least three hours after class. Four hours, if you can manage it.
And I mean every day. When exams are close, you’ll want to study ten hours
a day on your own.”
“Huuuh? No way, no way! There’s no way I can study like that. Come
on, you know that, Yukimuu,” said Hasebe.
“My older sister is a teacher. She always studied that much before an
exam as her usual routine.”
“Well, maybe you just come from a really elite lineage! Yukimuu, are
you thinking of becoming a teacher?”
“There’s nothing particularly ‘elite’ about becoming a teacher. If I
wanted that, why would I come to a school like this, one unlike any others in
the world?”
Yukimura had a point. If you wanted to be a teacher, there wasn’t any
particular benefit in specifically choosing this school.
“So, why did you come here?”
“It doesn’t really matter. Do you want to ask everyone why they
decided to enroll? If you had someone trying to pry into your business, you’d
understand how it feels,” said Yukimura.
Page 134
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
He was clearly trying to shoot Hasebe down, but unfortunately, his
response appeared to have the opposite effect. Hasebe didn’t look particularly
upset. Rather, she volunteered her own life story.
“I got interested in the school because of the promotional advertising
they ran, you know? I mean, advancing to higher education or getting a good
job just because you graduated from here? Who wouldn’t choose this place?
Isn’t that good enough for most people?” she said.
“A lot of people also enroll here because it’s free. We don’t even have
to pay for our dorms, and the campus is set up so that we can survive without
using any points. Right now, I appreciate that more than any guarantees after
graduation,” said Miyake.
“Don’t you think that’s kind of lame? I mean, being able to go to
university or get a job anywhere is incredible,” said Hasebe.
“Look, talk about your dreams after we’re done with the final exam.
The system you expect great things from won’t do anything for you if you
don’t graduate from Class A, Hasebe,” said Yukimura.
“There’s gotta be some kind of bonus, though, right?” she replied.
“Like, maybe the school lied about how only Class A wins. If we manage to
graduate, who’s to say we can’t do whatever we want?”
“That’s not very likely. If that were the case, we’d have heard about it,
and I’ve heard nothing of the sort, not even during club activities. Besides,
the second and third-year Class D students seem pretty miserable,” said
Miyake.
He had a point. I’d sensed no drive or ambition from the third-year
Class D student I met earlier in the year.
“If we don’t make it to Class A, graduating from this school could even
have a negative impact on our careers. That’s why I absolutely must graduate
from Class A,” said Yukimura.
“Ah, wow. That’d be the worst,” agreed Hasebe.
Good colleges looked for people who’d attended prestigious schools
and boasted impressive personal accomplishments. However, as far as the
Advanced Nurturing High School was concerned, you were a defective
product if you graduated from anything other than Class A. Universities and
Page 135
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
corporations had to know that about our school.
“Miyacchi, you’ve really committed to this study group, huh? And here
I thought you’d quit right away,” said Hasebe.
“Well, don’t you think it’s odd that you’re still here? You usually don’t
want anything to do with anyone,” said Miyake.
“Well, sure. But if it’s a study group with you three, it’s all right,” she
replied.
“Hasebe, do you mind if I ask you a question?” I said.
“Hmm?”
“Are you and Satou close?”
“Satou-san? No, not especially. I don’t really like big groups, anyway.
If you’re curious about her, shouldn’t you ask Karuizawa-san?”
If I could do that, I wouldn’t be this stressed out. I didn’t want to talk
about this with anyone too close to Satou. “Well…”
I couldn’t tell Hasebe the truth. Yukimura noticed that I was in trouble
and spoke up. “I understand why you’re concerned,” he told me. “She’s your
partner. Not knowing her strengths and weaknesses has to be nerve-racking.”
“Ah, yeah,” added Hasebe. “That’s right, you did say you guys were
paired together.”
“Satou and I don’t have anything in common, so I can’t just talk to
her,” I replied.
Hasebe put her hands together, as if offering condolences. However,
she seemed to have a new idea. “If it’s hard to ask Karuizawa-san, why not
try asking Kyo-chan? She and Satou-san are close.”
“Huh? Kyo-chan?” I didn’t recall ever hearing that nickname before.
“I’m talking about Kikyou-chan. You hang out with her a lot, don’t
you, Ayanokouji-kun?”
This particular task certainly suited Kushida. She knew a lot about the
class’s internal affairs. If it weren’t for the issue with Horikita, I wouldn’t
have hesitated to ask her for help. However, I doubted that she was someone
I could rely on.
Page 136
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Miyake added his two cents. “Yeah. Asking Karuizawa might be one
thing, but Kushida should be good, right? She gets along with everyone,
doesn’t she, Hasebe?”
“Mm-hmm. There’re a lot of girls I hate, but I like Kyo-chan. She does
so much for the class without even batting an eye, and she’s always cheerful.
Normally, I don’t like talking to other people, but Kyo-chan is special. She
actually listens to you, and she’d never ever go around telling others what
you said.”
“Even you need some girl talk, huh?” said Miyake.
“Rude, Miyacchi. Young maidens have lots of things to talk about,”
said Hasebe.
“What kinds of things?”
“Why should I tell you? You’d definitely spill the beans to everyone.”
“Would not. Well, probably not. Depends on what it is.”
“If you’re worried about anything, it’s probably best to discuss it with
Kushida,” Yukimura told me.
“Right?” agreed Hasebe. “I don’t know whether you like Satou-san or
not, but if you told Kushida-san, she definitely wouldn’t let it slip.”
“What? You like Satou, Ayanokouji?” said Miyake.
“I didn’t say anything like that. I just asked whether Hasebe was close
to Satou, that’s all.”
“Isn’t that kind of suspicious, though?” said Hasebe. “You haven’t
exactly been tight with Satou-san until now, right?”
“Ayanokouji said that he was worried about Satou because they’re
partners. Did you already forget that?” asked Miyake.
Hasebe didn’t back down. “Because of the way he asked, it just feels
like there’s more to it, y’know?”
Girls had a powerful radar for secrets that I couldn’t comprehend.
“That reminds me. Is it okay if we swing by the convenience store real
quick?” Miyake’s proposal derailed the conversation. Thank goodness.
Kushida was clearly a vital asset that Class D couldn’t afford to lose.
Page 137
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
From the very beginning, she’d been involved in everything. She dedicated
herself to supporting other students, and now she was seeing the fruits of her
labor. Everyone in our class liked her. When someone wasn’t present, people
usually griped about them, so it was remarkable to hear only good things said
about Kushida in her absence.
“Ah, yeah. I need to make a stop for some treats, too. Come on, guys,”
said Hasebe.
“You’re such a child,” said Yukimura. Still, he joined them.
Page 138

The four of us stood outside the convenience store, eating ice cream.
“Whew, having ice cream when it’s slightly chilly outside is a trip,”
said Hasebe, bringing a spoonful of vanilla ice cream to her mouth.
Yukimura must not have eaten ice cream much, because he was
reading the ingredients. “This is just a smorgasbord of preservatives and food
coloring.”
“How do you enjoy anything if you’re that worried about every single
detail?” said Hasebe.
“I’m particular about what I eat. I’ve been thinking about how I was in
such poor shape when we were on the island. Now, I buy my food from the
organic section in the supermarket.”
“You sure are serious,” said Hasebe.
“Besides, convenience store food is expensive. If you just make the
short trip over to the mall, you can get the same things at a lower price. Why
not buy your groceries more efficiently?” asked Yukimura, pointing to the
grocery bags that Hasebe carried.
“Yukimuu, you’re not one of those penny-pinching misers, are you?”
“I’m just conscientious about money. Also…what’s with calling me
‘Yukimuu’?”
“You’re Yukimura-kun, so, Yukimuu. When I make friends with
someone, I give them a nickname. Miyacchi, Yukimuu, and Ayanon. Hmm…
for some reason, Ayanon doesn’t really roll off the tongue,” said Hasebe.
There it was. My first iffy nickname.
“Quit calling me Yukimuu. It’s embarrassing.”
“You don’t like it?”
“I didn’t say that. I said it’s embarrassing.”
“Come on, it’s not a big deal.”
Page 139
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“It’s just that calling me Y-Yukimuu in front of other people is a
little…” Yukimura trailed off.
Hasebe responded with a surprisingly serious look. “You know, I think
our friendship is coming along nicely,” she said.
“A friendship where we can use nicknames, you mean?”
“Well, you and Ayanon are like me and Miyacchi. We’re all loners,
right?” said Hasebe.
“Hmm. I suppose so.”
“Now that I’ve actually tried becoming a member of this group, I feel
more comfortable than I expected. Also, Yukimuu and Ayanon, you don’t
have many friends, right? We’re more than halfway through the second
semester, so I thought I’d like to be friends with a new group. It’s not like
I’m trying to make up for lost time or anything. I just wanted to give you
guys nicknames so that we could open up to each other. What do you two
think?” asked Hasebe.
Miyake spoke up. “Yeah. This isn’t too bad. I feel like I’ve gotten used
to being in a group. I don’t get along well with Sudou and those guys, and I
think Hirata’s kinda in another league. He’s always surrounded by girls.”
“Right? So, what do you two think?” Hasebe repeated.
Both Hasebe and Miyake seemed to want the four of us to be friends.
Would Yukimura turn them down?
“I just wanted to oversee your studies. When the test is done, this study
group will end. But…I suppose there will be more tests. So, I don’t mind
forming a group for the sake of efficiency,” said Yukimura.
“Okay, that was a little insulting. But…thanks,” said Hasebe.
“Well, y-yeah. We want to keep the school from expelling anyone,
after all,” Yukimura replied.
“That just leaves Ayanon. Oh, but Ayanon, since you’re already in a
group with Horikita-san, will this be difficult for you? You hang out with
Ike-kun and Yamauchi-kun, too,” said Hasebe.
“Well, I’m not better or worse than any of our classmates, but I think
I’m a little different,” I replied. “There are lots of ways Ike, Horikita, and I
Page 140
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
aren’t compatible. I suppose it’s good that I don’t have to pretend to be
someone I’m not around you guys. Horikita and I just sit next to each other in
class. It’s not like we’re in a clique or anything.”
“I see. Well then, it’s decided. From now on, we’ll be known as the
Ayanokouji Group. Nice to meet all you group members!”
“Wait. Why’d you name the group after me?”
“Well, you brought us together, more or less. Isn’t that enough?”
“I don’t object. Besides, it’d be weird if we called ourselves the
Yukimura Group,” said Yukimura.
“One more thing. From here on out, let’s ban the use of formal
surnames in the Ayanokouji Group,” said Hasebe.
“You can go ahead and ban whatever, but I won’t say M-Miyacchi,
or…A-Ayanon, or anything like that. It’s embarrassing,” said Yukimura.
It would definitely feel really weird for Yukimura or me to call Miyake
something like “Miyacchi.” I was relieved that Yukimura felt the same.
“Well, let’s at least use first names. My name’s Haruka. You can call
me whatever you want. What’s your first name again, Miyacchi?” said
Hasebe.
“It’s Akito.”
Hasebe looked expectantly at Yukimura and me.
“Akito, huh? Easy enough. Ayanokouji, your first name’s Kiyotaka,
isn’t it?” said Yukimura. We’d been roommates during the cruise.
“And your first name’s Teruhiko, right, Yukimura?” I replied.
Yukimura’s expression darkened for some reason. “You remembered?”
he asked. He looked troubled by that.
“So, Yukimuu’s first name is Teruhiko, huh? Wonder if I should think
of another nickname,” said Hasebe.
“Knock it off,” snapped Yukimura. Hasebe shrank back.
“Is something wrong?” I asked.
“I’m okay with calling you all by your first names. I accept that much.
But will you please stop calling me Teruhiko?” he replied.
Page 141

“So, you’re fine calling us by our first names, but you hate being called
by your first name?!” asked Hasebe.
“It’s not that I don’t like any of you. It’s just that I hate my name. I
never really had to worry about it before, because no one called me by it,”
said Yukimura.
“It’s not especially unconventional. Isn’t it actually pretty common?”
asked Miyake. “Is there any particular reason why you hate it?”
“Yes. My mother named me Teruhiko. She’s a contemptible woman
who left the family when I was little, so I reject the name she gave me,” said
Yukimura. Hasebe and Miyake’s faces stiffened, and Yukimura changed the
topic. “Sorry. I made you uncomfortable.”
“No, no, I’m sorry. I just blurted out your name without permission,
after all,” said Hasebe.
“You don’t need to apologize. You didn’t know. Most people like
using their first name, after all. I’d prefer not to ruin the mood, so why don’t
you call me Keisei from now on? It’s the name I’ve used since I was a child,”
said Yukimura.
“Keisei? So, you have two first names, Yukimuu? This is crazy
complicated.”
“Keisei isn’t my real name. It’s the name my father wanted to give me,
so I made it my own after my mother left. You could call me Keisei or
Yukimura,” he replied.
If that was what he wanted, that was what we would do. Besides, it
wasn’t weird for someone to have two different names. Ordinary people
made a habit of it, as did celebrities.
“Well, I didn’t mean to use a name you didn’t like. Right, Miyacchi?”
“Yeah. Nice to meet you, Keisei.”
“Sorry for being so selfish about that…Kiyotaka, Akito, and Haruka,”
replied Yukimura.
“No worries. Everyone’s got their own issues,” I said.
Just like I had a past that I didn’t want exposed, Yukimura…no,
Keisei…also had a past he wanted to hide.
Page 142
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
I tried saying everyone else’s names just like Keisei had done. “Akito,
Keisei, and…Haruka, right? I’ll remember those,” I told them. It was even
more stressful to call a girl by her first name.
“Anyway, Kiyotaka? We won’t call you ‘Ayanon,’ but what about
‘Kiyopon’?” Haruka seemed stuck on the issue of my name. “Yeah, that one
definitely rolls off the tongue better. Yukimuu, do you want to call him that,
too?”
Whoa. I’d gotten an even more embarrassing nickname. Just thinking
about Hasebe calling me “Kiyopon” in front of people gave me goosebumps.
“I won’t call him that. It’s embarrassing. I already decided to call him
Kiyotaka,” said Yukimura.
In the end, we decided to call one another by our given names. Before
long, it felt completely natural.
I looked behind me to check on the person following us.
Were you okay with just listening in, Sakura?
Every time we’d held a study session, Sakura had tailed us. Today, she
watched from a slight distance. She probably couldn’t hear everything we
said, maybe enough to just barely get the gist of our conversation. The
moment this new group formed was probably her last chance to join.
If she didn’t assert herself, then…
“Well, now that we’ve all learned one another’s names, let’s start over.
From here on, the four of us will be known as—”
“U-u-um, excuse me!”
CRASH! The trash can next to us rattled. Sakura clambered back to her
feet and walked over, tense and nervous.
“Sakura?” The others said her name simultaneously.
“I-I also want to join Ayanokouji-kun’s group!”
Sakura summoned up every last bit of courage she could to force those
words out. She was incredibly nervous, her face turning a deep shade of red.
She was so flustered that she didn’t notice that her glasses were crooked.
“Do you want to join the group because you’re anxious about the
exam? I mean, when you consider your own scores and your partner, it’d be
Page 143
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
understandable if you were worried, Sakura,” said Keisei. “Personally, I think
you should join Horikita’s group. I’m not sure I can tutor too many people.
Besides, your situation’s different. You probably need to work on other
subjects.”
Sakura tried again. “N-no, it’s not that. I just… I genuinely want to join
the group!” she answered.
As the saying went, shame committed on a journey could be left
behind. Or, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas.
“Come on. It’s fine if Sakura participates. She kinda fits in with the
group,” said Akito.
“Is letting me join really all right?” she asked.
“I mean, adding one person’s not a big deal. Besides, it isn’t like you
need any qualifications to take part. We’re all loners, so I think it’s
appropriate. Am I wrong?”
“Loners, huh? Well, I guess you’re right,” I mused. “Keisei, is it okay
with you?”
“I have no objections. But I don’t want our group to grow any larger
than this. Sakura is easy to accept, but if someone annoying joins, I’m done,”
said Keisei.
“Th-thank you, Miyake-kun… Yukimura-kun…”
The only person left was Haruka. She was usually welcoming, but this
time, she didn’t have a smile on her face.
“Sorry, Sakura-san, but you haven’t convinced me yet,” said Haruka.
“Ah…so I-I, uh, I can’t…?”
“Well, look. I’m really looking forward to being part of this group. Or,
rather, I get the feeling I’m going to enjoy it. So…” Haruka pointed at
Sakura. “If you want to join, you have to follow our one big rule. We call
each other by our first names, or by nicknames. So, Sakura-san, uh…”
Haruka looked at me. “Wait, what’s her first name again?”
“Airi,” I replied without missing a beat.
“We’ll all call you Airi, and you’ll use all of our first names. Are you
okay with that?”
Page 144
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Sakura wasn’t good at dealing with interpersonal relationships. We all
knew that, which was why Haruka was testing to see whether she could
manage this.
“U-um…”
I tried to help the bewildered Sakura. “Keisei, Akito, and Haruka.”
“K-Keisei-kun, Akito-kun, Haruka…san… Whew…” said Sakura,
barely whispering the words.
“There’s no need to use honorifics, right?” Akito said.
“Yeah. As long as you use our first names, that’s good enough. Now,
all that’s left is using Kiyopon’s nickname.”
Sakura’s face reddened. A mysterious sound escaped her lips. “Ah-
hyuu!”
“You’ve seemed pretty close to Kiyopon for a while now, so calling
him that shouldn’t be a stretch, right?” said Haruka. She was merciless.
“Kiyotaka is fine,” I said. Kiyopon was a bridge too far. It was
embarrassing even in my head.
“Ki-Kiyo-Kiyo…pyo!”
Everyone focused on Sakura. She hated attention, which made her
stammer, which made them pay more attention. It was turning into a vicious
cycle.
“I don’t know what kind of effect this group will have on you, but I
think it’s good that you’re joining, Sakura. You’ve taken a big step forward.
Just one more step can’t hurt,” I told her gently.
“Yeah…K-Kiyotaka-kun. I look forward to studying with you all.”
Sakura looked me square in the eye.
“Okay, you passed. I’m in favor of Airi joining us,” said Haruka. With
that, Sakura became part of the group. “Come on, Kiyopon, try calling Airi
by her first name.”
“Uh…hi, Airi.”
“H-hello!”
Even though we were stiff and nervous, we both managed.
Page 145
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“From now on, we five are the Ayanokouji Group. Looking forward to
it!” said Haruka.
Apparently, the group would be named after me whether I liked it or
not.
Page 146
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
6.4
 
And so, the Ayanokouji Group (saying it still felt weird) was
officially established. We began to make plans together, including Airi.
Haruka created a group chat, making it much easier to talk when we weren’t
physically together. Because we were often alone in our rooms, our chats
were lively and long.
After we finish class tomorrow, do you all feel like seeing a movie to
take our minds off things? Haruka texted.
Wait, are you talking about that one new movie?
Yeah, yeah, that one. I heard that it comes out tomorrow. Since
everyone’s studying right now, scoring tickets should be easy!
I suppose that taking a break is a good idea. When you say “you all,” I
assume I’m invited?
Of course! You’re part of the group, Yukimuu. But I guess I did spring
this on you guys. If you don’t have time, we can wait and go after the test.
Akito hadn’t seen these messages yet, but when he did, he’d probably
agree to go. I wondered whether I should take the initiative here. Even though
I was a little nervous, I replied in the group chat. I’ll join you.
A message from Airi came only a few seconds later. I want to go, too.
All right. If Akito goes, I’ll come as well, replied Yukimura.
Akito himself sent a response in a couple minutes. Sounds good to me.
Can you reserve our tickets?
Sure. I’ll collect points from you later. Thanks, everyone!
The group chat quieted down after that. Haruka had probably switched
over to her web browser to reserve our seats online.
I’m looking forward to seeing the movie, Airi texted me.
Yeah, me too.
I’m really excited about tomorrow, Kiyotaka-kun. Goodnight. She
ended the chat on that especially polite note.
Page 147
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“So, I’m going to the movies with a group, huh?” I muttered to myself.
It seemed I was somehow developing a social life. This’d be normal
for anyone else, but I trembled with a kind of excitement I’d never
experienced before. I decided I should probably hit the sack early to make
sure I wasn’t sluggish tomorrow.
My phone rang, and I answered it. “Seems like you’re awake,” said
Horikita.
“It’s still only ten o’clock. Do you need something?”
“The library study groups are just about finished. After tomorrow’s
session, I’d like to make some final preparations for the exam. Can you come
along with me? If you could tell Yukimura-kun as well, that’d be a big help.”
“Tomorrow, huh?” That was the day I’d just agreed to see a movie.
“If that’s inconvenient, the day after tomorrow is fine. But Thursday is
the limit. The questions are almost complete, but I think we need to change
some of them.”
“I’ll talk it over with Keisei. Is it okay if we’re late? We should also
get in touch with Hirata and Karuizawa ahead of time, if we need to,” I told
Horikita.
“Keisei? It seems like you and Yukimura-kun have gotten quite close.
You don’t need to worry about the other two. I already talked to them,” said
Horikita.
I wasn’t the only one who’d gotten closer to others, evidently. Horikita
seemed to have successfully bridged the divide between herself and the
students in her study sessions. I’d be delighted if she got on good terms with
Hirata and Karuizawa, at the very least.
Just as I hung up, I received another text. Apparently, I was popular
tonight. This time the message wasn’t from Airi, though, but from
Karuizawa.
I confirmed that a girl was walking around today asking whether
people saw how much sugar Hasebe-san puts in her coffee. Apparently,
Hasebe puts a ton in, so people had noticed.
Just as I thought. Rather than being incredibly perceptive, Hiyori was
quick-witted. She’d pretended to display remarkable powers of observation to
Page 148
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
shake us up.
I think that Horikita’s going to contact you about tomorrow, but we
plan to meet around 8 p.m.
Isn’t that pretty late? Karuizawa asked.
I’m busy before that. I’m going to a movie with my study group.
A movie? Are you seeing that new one, by any chance?
Seems like you know it. Anyway, I have a favor I’d like to ask of you.
I gave Karuizawa detailed instructions. Once she finished reading
everything, she sent me an irritated reply. This is another super-annoying
errand. What are you even after?
I’ll explain when it’s done. It’s for your own sake.
Yeah, sure. See ya tomorrow.
I thought that was it from her. However, immediately afterward, I
received another message. There wasn’t any text, but there was a little
sticker. It was a cute strawberry shortcake with a bunch of candles in it.
Happy belated.
That additional message popped up after the cake. Karuizawa didn’t
text me again.
“She noticed that it was my birthday? But how?”
I hadn’t told anyone about my birthday. Then I recalled that our chat
app had a field for your birthdate, in addition to the fields for your name and
email address. I hadn’t chosen to keep that information private.
I’d thought that no one would notice my birthday this year. Karuizawa
was the first.
After finishing my conversation with her, I deleted all the texts.
Though I hesitated, I also deleted the birthday sticker she sent. Afterward, I
accessed Karuizawa’s profile and saw that her birthday was March 8.
“Guess I’ll remember that.”

Class the next day felt surprisingly long. Maybe that was because I’d
gradually begun to look forward to the study sessions with my friends. When
school was done, I headed toward the movie theater with Yukimura and the
others.
“It kinda feels exciting to go out with everyone…K-Kiyotaka-kun,”
said Airi, walking next to me. She sounded reserved, but also upbeat. She
was like a child, but I felt the same way, so I guess I was childish, too.
“Yeah, it does. It’s not a bad feeling.”
“Hee hee. Kiyotaka-kun.”
“What’s up?”
“Huh? What do you mean?”
“You said my name.”
“I-I did?! S-sorry, you must’ve heard wrong!”
I didn’t think I’d misheard her. Upon arriving at the Keyaki Mall, we
immediately went to the movie theater. Haruka had bought the tickets ahead
of time, and she handed them out to us one by one.
“I’m looking forward to this.”
“Ayanokouji-kun!” Satou Maya’s voice called out to me. Why was she
here?
“Hey, are you going to see that movie right now? You know, that one
everyone’s talking about?!” she asked excitedly. “To tell you the truth, I
came here to see it, too. So did Karuizawa-san and the others,” she added.
Behind Satou, a crowd of girls approached the theater. “Looks like it,”
I replied. “Did Karuizawa invite you?”
“Nope. When I mentioned wanting to see a movie after our study
group, Karuizawa-san said that she wanted to come, too. So, we all decided
to go. Since we’re all here, let’s see it together!” said Satou, quickly latching
on to my arm.
Page 150
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Huuuh?!” Airi yelped.
“H-hey, knock it off,” I told Satou.
“Huh? Why? This is okay, isn’t it?” she asked. Satou sounded calm
and composed, but her face was red. She was trying a little too hard.
Page 151
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Oh, what a coincidence. Yukimura-kun, Ayanokouji-kun. Oh, and
Hasebe-san and Sakura-san, too,” said Karuizawa in a slightly condescending
manner.
It wasn’t a coincidence at all. I’d told her last night.
“What an unpleasant coincidence. I’m going inside.” Keisei went on
ahead by himself, looking rather indignant.
“Well, guess I’ll go, too,” I said.
Separating myself from Satou somewhat forcefully, I followed Keisei
inside the theater. It was almost entirely full, and the scent of popcorn and hot
dogs tickled my nostrils. We’d reserved the five seats farthest to the back and
right. Satou, Karuizawa, and their group had gone to buy popcorn and soda,
and hadn’t come in yet.
As I sat down, Airi leaned over and whispered to me. “Um, K-
Kiyotaka-kun?”
Since everyone around us was chatting loudly, I didn’t think she
needed to speak that softly. “What’s the matter?”
“Well, Kiyotaka-kun, it’s… Recently, you’ve gotten along pretty well
with, um, Satou-san, right?” she asked.
Considering what Airi had seen, it wasn’t surprising that she was
curious. However, I needed to keep that particular rumor from spreading.
“That’s not how it is. Satou and I are exam partners. We’ve been studying
together.”
“B-but…p-people don’t normally walk, um, a-arm-in-arm like that, do
they?”
“That wasn’t really arm-in-arm. She just grabbed me,” I replied.
“Well, if you dislike it, you could just, um, shake her off,” said Airi.
While timid, Airi’s comeback was correct. I’d passively gone along
with Satou.
“I understand. I don’t think there will be a next time.”
“A-also…”
There was more?
Page 152
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Before we partnered up, you went somewhere with Satou-san alone,
didn’t you?” she asked.
I remembered the day Satou had called me over in the classroom.
Hadn’t Airi watched me?
“I-Is there s-something g-going between you two?”
“No.”
Well, that wasn’t entirely true. Then again, all Satou did was get my
contact information. Besides, Airi and I had also exchanged contact
information. It was nothing to feel weird about.
“Not convinced?” I asked.
“N-no, I am. S-sorry. I’ve been asking you all these strange
questions… Did I make you uncomfortable?”
“Not at all. If there’s something bothering you, you can ask me any
time,” I told her.
“I’ll keep an eye on you, then, Kiyotaka-kun,” she replied. “L-Leave it
to me!”
Er, thanks? Not too closely, I hope.
Well, I didn’t want to burst Airi’s bubble. She looked very confident
now.
After that, I enjoyed the movie in peace and quiet. Well, as much as I
could. The movie itself was very strange.

There were many shops in the Keyaki Mall. Most were
establishments people frequented daily, like supermarkets, but there were
specialty shops as well. For example, there were stations that helped deal
with any electric, gas, or water utilities problems you might have, and a
delivery service that brought items from the convenience store to your room.
There was also a dry cleaner’s that a salaryman would probably use
frequently, but students at this school didn’t need as often. Unless you
happened to get a blazer dirty, of course.
It was past eight o’clock on Thursday night, and our test was next
week. It was closing time for the shops, so everyone from Class D gathered
in a karaoke room. You could hold a meeting there without having to worry
about anyone overhearing. Although it probably would have been best to do
this in someone’s room, none of us wanted to.
“Hey, is it okay if I sing?”
“Wait, Karuizawa-san. We didn’t meet here to have fun,” said Hirata.
“Even though we came all this way, and there’s karaoke right here?”
“We came because you said that you didn’t want to use the dorms to
study.”
“Yeah, fine. But, come on, isn’t it kinda stupid to go all the way out to
a place that has karaoke and not sing?”
“Just enjoy the food and drinks and deal with it,” said Horikita.
Karuizawa had already put in an order. There was a bunch of junk food on
the table, plus the drink she’d gotten for herself.
“Then let’s sing a duet together after the meeting’s over, Yousuke-
kun.”
“Sure,” said Hirata. “It’ll be nice to relax afterward.”
“I agree,” replied Karuizawa. “I do want to make sure we discuss this
test, but it’s been quite a while since I could do karaoke.”
“Okay, I’m going to start,” said Horikita, ignoring Karuizawa. “First,
Page 154
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
our study sessions. To be perfectly honest, I think the results have been
fantastic. The boys were imbeciles at first, so I was worried, but fortunately,
they studied hard.”
“It’s like an English dictionary is just flying out of my mouth all the
time, dude!” said Sudou.
“Sudou-kun has improved significantly compared to where he started.
His concentration, in particular, got better by leaps and bounds. However,
Sudou, don’t forget that your basic abilities are still inferior to a first-year
junior high school student’s,” said Horikita.
“I studied this hard, and I’m still only at a first-year junior high level?”
replied Sudou despairingly.
“Considering that you began at an elementary school level, that’s
amazing,” said Horikita.
“H-Horikita-san, don’t you think that’s going a little too far?” Hirata
asked.
“He didn’t even know that the mathematical constant pi existed until
recently,” Horikita countered.
Dang. To think Sudou had lived this long without knowing what pi
was.
“Huh? That’s so stupid!” said Karuizawa. Even though Karuizawa
wasn’t very studious herself, she was certainly better than that.
“Shut up, Karuizawa. You probably don’t even know it either,” said
Sudou.
“No, no, no, I do. Even I know pi is 3.14,” said Karuizawa. Our
conversation was rapidly devolving. Everyone involved would end up with a
headache.
“Please stop.” Yukimura said. “Horikita, is Sudou really going to be
okay?”
“Like I said, his fundamental scholastic abilities are low. But if we just
focus on the things a first-year, second-semester high school student needs to
know, then I think so. He definitely shouldn’t expect to fail this exam. What
about you, Yukimura-kun? Did you manage to resolve Hasebe-san and
Miyake-kun’s issues?” asked Horikita.
Page 155
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Of course. Ayanokouji watched everything closely, so he can back me
up on that. Right?” Keisei asked me.
“I don’t think there was a better method we could’ve gone with. I’m
not worried about anyone,” I replied.
“I’m glad. I’d absolutely hate to lose anybody from Class D,” said
Kushida.
“Yeah. But are we really going to do okay?” said Karuizawa. She still
seemed unsettled. “Look, I hate the idea of having fewer classmates. But this
test always gets someone kicked out, right? So, like, there’s no guarantee
Sudou-kun and I won’t fail, right?”
“Well, I can’t guarantee that,” Kushida said. “But…”
“Then don’t act like it’s a done deal.”
The somewhat relaxed atmosphere became tense.
“You know, Kushida-san, I kinda feel as if you’ve been paying us lip
service for a while now,” said Karuizawa.
“R-really? But I just want everyone to pass,” said Kushida.
“Man, it sure must be nice. Being smart, I mean. You don’t have any
idea what’s gonna happen to me,” snapped Karuizawa.
“It’s okay, Karuizawa-san. You studied hard in your group,” said
Hirata.
“Kushida-san, I’ve wanted to say this to you for a while now. Don’t
you think you’re taking this goody two-shoes act a bit too far?”
“Uh…r-really?” stammered Kushida.
“Can you please calm down, Karuizawa-san? We’re in the middle of
discussing our final exam. Don’t waste our time,” said Horikita.
“Be quiet, Horikita-san. Hey, Kushida-san. Are you making fun of me
in your head right now? Thinking about how stupid I am?” asked Karuizawa.
“I wouldn’t do something like that,” said Kushida.
“Then don’t patronize me. Tests are always hard for me, no matter how
many I take. Are you going to be responsible if I fail?” asked Karuizawa.
This was getting absurd. Karuizawa’s inexplicable anger baffled not
Page 156
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
just Kushida, but everyone else. Then, in a move no one saw coming,
Karuizawa picked up her glass of grape juice and dumped it over Kushida.
The juice soaked into Kushida’s blazer.
“Karuizawa-san!” Hirata grabbed Karuizawa’s hand, which still held
the cup. “You can’t do this. That’s not okay.”
“B-but… Are you saying I’m in the wrong here?” asked Karuizawa.
“Yes, Karuizawa-san. Kushida-san hasn’t done anything bad to you,”
said Horikita. Even she, locked in a cold war with Kushida, couldn’t defend
this.
“I’m fine, really. I don’t mind. Please don’t blame Karuizawa-san,
okay?” said Kushida.
“No. Karuizawa is at fault here,” said Keisei.
“Oh, sure. I’m the bad guy. Kushida-san is the class’s favorite, after
all,” said Karuizawa. She turned toward me, as if I were her last hope. “Hey,
Ayanokouji-kun. Whose side are you on?”
“Whose side am I on? There are no sides. You’re in the wrong,
Karuizawa,” I told her.
“I knew it. Everyone is my enemy,” said Karuizawa. She got up and
grabbed her bag.
“Karuizawa-san. If you leave now, you’ll regret it later. I don’t want
that,” said Hirata.
“So, what do you want me to do, then?” barked Karuizawa.
“First, apologize to Kushida-san. That’s the most important thing,” said
Hirata.
Karuizawa wouldn’t even listen to her supposed boyfriend. She stood
her ground. “So, even though I don’t think I did anything wrong, I have to
apologize?” she asked.
“You have to talk to her,” said Hirata.
Karuizawa stood completely still and silent for a moment. Then,
slowly, she spoke. “Sorry.”
“No, it’s completely all right. I should’ve been more understanding of
how you felt, Karuizawa-san,” said Kushida. She could have been angry,
Page 157
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
under the circumstances, but forgiveness came easily from her lips.
Karuizawa looked guilty as she sat back down next to Hirata. “I guess I
lost my cool. Sorry,” she said again. Kushida responded with a gracious
smile.
“Thank you.” Hirata patted his chest and let out a sigh of relief.
However, this didn’t necessarily mean that everything was settled.
“Kushida-san, do you have a spare blazer to wear tomorrow? Will you
be okay?” asked Horikita.
“Ah, no. My first blazer got damaged, so this was the only one I had
left,” said Kushida.
The school had provided us with two blazers each when we first
arrived, but accidents happened, and students could simply outgrow their
uniforms. A store in the Keyaki Mall specialized in student uniforms.
However, it took time and cost many points to tailor clothing.
“Ain’t there a dry cleaner and a laundromat? I could bring your blazer
in with some of my sweaty basketball clothes. If I take them in today, you
should get the blazer back first thing tomorrow morning,” said Sudou.
“I didn’t know there was a dry cleaner,” replied Kushida. “That sounds
like a good solution.”
“Well, it’s not exactly an apology, but at least let me cover your
cleaning fee,” said Karuizawa.
“Really, don’t worry about it,” said Kushida.
“I’d feel too guilty if I didn’t.”
“Are you sure?”
“Yeah. Please let me do this much,” said Karuizawa, and so, she paid

On the way back to my dorm, I came across Katsuragi standing next
to a water fountain. He didn’t seem to be looking for anyone in particular, so
I called out to him.
“What are you doing?” I asked.
“Ayanokouji? Oh, nothing. Just thinking a little about the final exam
next week,” he replied.
“In a place like this?”
“I wanted some time alone to think in peace and quiet,” said Katsuragi.
“Do you feel like the exam will go well?”
I decided to respond honestly. “Dunno. But everyone’s studying really
hard.”
“Is that so? It would be nice if no one were expelled,” said Katsuragi.
I didn’t feel as if he was particularly concerned for his classmates.
“Did something happen?”
“When you were in junior high, were you ever class representative or
on the student council?”
“No, wasn’t interested at all,” I replied.
“I’ve been a student council member since elementary school. I even
served as student council president in both elementary and junior high. But,
after coming to this school, I had to make some significant course
corrections,” said Katsuragi.
“Come to think of it, you didn’t join the student council here.”
“I wanted to, but I couldn’t get Student Council President Horikita’s
attention.”
So far, this had nothing to do with the final exam.
“At first glance, the student council president and class representatives
don’t appear to have much authority. Most students think that participating is
nothing more than a waste of time and effort. That’s why only a few people
Page 159
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
want to join the council,” said Katsuragi.
I shared the majority’s feelings on that. I didn’t want any management
position.
“However, those roles come with certain privileges. There’s a divide
between people who hold the positions and people who don’t—one that can’t
be crossed. I’ve lost those privileges,” said Katsuragi.
“But your standing in Class A is still good, right?”
“If that were the case, we absolutely wouldn’t have chosen Class B as
our target for the final exam,” he replied.
True, someone like Katsuragi would’ve picked Class C or Class D.
He’d have chosen the path of strong defense and decisive victory.
“Is it okay to talk to me about your class’s internal politics?” I asked.
“It’s fine. You understand what it’s like.”
“You know, you should cut yourself some slack. You’re trying to
singlehandedly carry Class A, but I bet if you relaxed a little, they’d still be
fine. The important thing right now is to maintain your position,” I told him.
“I suppose. Hmm…to be told to maintain my position by a Class D
student who should be chasing after us,” he responded, clearly amused.
“Perhaps I can see things objectively precisely because I can’t catch up
with you.”
When the two of us got to the dormitory, we found a crowd in the
lobby.
“It’s pretty noisy in here. Did something happen?” Katsuragi asked.
“Dunno. Should we try asking around?” I caught sight of the Professor
and called to him. “What happened?”
“Oh, Ayanokouji, is that you? It seems that all us first years somehow
received the same missive in our mailboxes.”
“The same letter?”
I slipped through the crowd, went over to my mailbox, and unlocked it.
Others peered over my shoulder as I opened the door.
I took out a letter folded into fourths and walked back to Sotomura.
Page 160
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Is this…?”
“Yes, it would seem so!”
A few moments later, Katsuragi returned with a similar piece of paper.
We unfolded our letters at nearly the same time. They said:
First-year Class B student Ichinose Honami may be collecting points
illegally. —Ryuuen Kakeru
Sotomura showed us the same message on his paper. Katsuragi
mumbled, “What is that guy planning by signing his name to this? If this
claim is baseless, the school will take disciplinary action against him.”
“If he’s risking that, does that mean his claim is true?”
“Well, I suppose that this is something I could see Ryuuen doing. If
people start to suspect Ichinose of fraud, it’ll make her life difficult,
regardless of whether it’s true. What Ryuuen is doing could be considered
defamation, but he wouldn’t care about something like that,” Katsuragi
explained.
It was true. Ryuuen had no reputation to lose.
“Hey, Ryuuen’s back!” said one student as Ryuuen entered the
building. I wondered whether he knew what had caused all the commotion.
“Hey, Ryuuen. What’re you trying to pull?!” One of the Class B guys
grabbed him.
“Hmm? What in the world are you talking about?”
“This! Your letter! This nonsense you handed everyone!”
“Oh, that. Pretty interesting stuff, huh?” said Ryuuen.
“What’s so interesting about it?! Look, this is going too far!”
“Fine then, let’s see some proof that Ichinose isn’t collecting points
illegally,” Ryuuen replied.
“That’s—”
“How about it, Ichinose?” asked Ryuuen, still holding the letter. He
looked at Ichinose, who’d just arrived.
“No matter what I say to you right now, you probably won’t believe
me, will you, Ryuuen-kun?”
Page 161
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“That’s right. Besides, it’s up to the school to decide whether you’re
doing something wrong.”
“I suppose so. Sorry, everyone. But please don’t worry. I’ll report to
the teachers tomorrow and prove that this is just a misunderstanding on
Ryuuen-kun’s part,” said Ichinose proudly.
Page 162
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Page 163
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“How exactly do you plan on proving that, Ichinose?” asked Ryuuen.
“I’ll explain everything in detail. I’ll tell them how many points I have,
and how I acquired them. If I do that, will you be satisfied?”
“Report it to the school? Why don’t you prove it right now, in front of
all of us?”
“Will you believe me if I just explain it to you, Ryuuen-kun?” Ichinose
countered.
“No, I won’t. Spewing lies is probably as easy for you as breathing,”
Ryuuen taunted.
“Then it stands to reason that, if I report my total points to the school,
there shouldn’t be any room for fraud, right?”
“Heh. I see. I suppose you have a point,” said Ryuuen.
“Are you convinced?!” shouted a Class B student.
“Humans are nasty, lying creatures. Isn’t it possible that Ichinose is
coming up with some kind of scheme to hide the evidence right now?” said
Ryuuen.
“What is that guy plotting? Even if Ichinose has lots of points, she’s far
from the kind of person who’d steal them. Ryuuen has absolutely no chance
of succeeding,” said Katsuragi. His expression grew even sterner.
“In that case, what can I do to make you believe me?” Ichinose asked
Ryuuen.
“First off, say how many points you have right here and now. Second,
explain how you acquired those points. I’ll report that information to the
school tomorrow. If you do that, you’ll convince the students who distrust
you, right?” said Ryuuen.
“I can’t accept, Ryuuen-kun.”
“So, you admit that you committed fraud?”
“That’s not what I’m saying. It’s precisely because I didn’t obtain my
points illegally that I can’t just show you all my cards. If I explain everything
to the school tomorrow, they should investigate. On top of that, if I did
commit fraud, they’d make everything public anyway, right?”
Page 164
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“There’s no guarantee that you’ll report your total points to the school
like you say you will.”
“Then go yourself, Ryuuen-kun. Tell them just what you wrote down
in this letter,” said Ichinose.
“Really? Heh. Seems like you’re pretty confident.” Ryuuen snickered.
It was true. A guilty person might have been nervous, yet Ichinose remained
as calm as ever. “Well, I’ll be looking forward to tomorrow.”
Ichinose watched Ryuuen board the elevator with a bold smile on his
face.
“Once the seed of doubt is planted, that doubt will grow until it’s
eradicated. Even an exemplary student like Ichinose isn’t exempt. The deeper
the doubt, the greater the loss of trust,” said Katsuragi.
He was right. The same thing applied to politicians. However high
their approval rating, one damaging lie could cost a great deal of support.
Once the lie proved entirely groundless, approval ratings might rebound,
perhaps even soar higher than ever. But, generally, it was hard to entirely
dispel allegations once they spread.
The next day, Ichinose did as she’d said she would. The school issued
an official notice that there was no fraudulent activity. They cleared her of all
suspicion.
A while back, I’d noticed that Ichinose possessed well over one million
personal points. She’d probably accumulated even more by now.

Chapter 7:
A Difference in Determination
 
Time ticked away as we continued to cram for the upcoming exams.
Students’ spirits dipped under the onslaught of grueling, endless work they
had to do. December arrived, and the final exam was less than three days
away. Tomorrow, we’d be off for the weekend, the final exam waiting for us
on Monday.
To be honest, the exam itself wasn’t too dangerous. As far as the Class
D students were concerned, we were more united than ever. Even Sudou and
the other slackers did their best. The issues were Ryuuen and Kushida.
Ryuuen’s two goals were to beat Class D, and to smoke out the puppet
master hiding behind Horikita. If he wanted to win in overall points, that
limited his tactics. The best he could do was get Class C to study extra hard,
or come up with extremely difficult test problems, both of which were
relatively ordinary strategies.
I didn’t know how fully Class C had united, or if they’d studied
extensively. We hadn’t seen them in the café, the library, the classrooms, or
anywhere else. Was it simple coincidence? Or were the Class C students
working somewhere in secret? Even if they did study extra hard, as long as
they didn’t surpass Class D, we’d be fine. At any rate, though, I had no idea
what their strategy was.
“Thinking about something?” asked Horikita.
“Oh, sorry,” I replied.
Horikita looked up at me from the base of the stairs. I hurried down
after her. She held a large manila envelope stuffed full of the questions she
and Hirata had slaved over for the past month. That envelope held Class D’s
fate, which was exactly why Horikita kept it as confidential as possible. She
wouldn’t even let me see the questions. Ultimately, she was the only one who
knew all of them.
“What are our chances?” I asked.
“Hard to say. Don’t expect too much. The school made many
Page 168
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
adjustments. However, there’s no doubt that we’ve completed the most
difficult part of the exam so far,” said Horikita.
She exuded confidence, so she’d probably done a solid job. The issue
was what came next. How would we protect these questions?
While making our way to the staff room, Horikita and I bumped into
Ryuuen in the hallway.
“Yo, Suzune.” Ryuuen wore a bold smile on his face. He also held a
manila envelope.
“Is this a coincidence? Or an ambush, perhaps?” asked Horikita.
“It’s inevitable. I was waiting for you.”
“An ambush, then.” Horikita let out an exasperated sigh and walked
past Ryuuen.
“You’re submitting your test problems at the last minute too, huh?
Let’s go together,” said Ryuuen, holding out his manila envelope. “Anyone
might try and sneak a peek at this, so I understand your caution.”
“You’re not worried about any traitors in your own class?” asked
Horikita somewhat mockingly.
“Ha. There’s no way anyone would be stupid enough to betray me,”
said Ryuuen.
“Yet you waited until the last minute to submit your questions,” said
Horikita.
Ryuuen probably couldn’t help but enjoy her ire. Horikita and I walked
on, and he followed us.
“I really hope that whatever intelligence you squeezed out of those
defective pieces of garbage in your class works in Class C’s favor,” he said.
Horikita ignored him. “Ayanokouji-kun, have you been studying
properly? How are things with you and your partner?” she asked me.
“I think we should be safe,” I replied.
“Thinking isn’t enough. We can’t afford to have a single student drop
out. Don’t get complacent, even though I’m sure we can handle whatever
Class C throws at us,” said Horikita.
Page 169
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Ryuuen responded to that verbal jab. “Oh ho! That’s an interesting
remark. You sound pretty arrogant.”
“Hmm, who knows? Maybe it was simply cheap provocation? Just
your style,” said Horikita.
“Maybe so,” Ryuuen replied.
As soon as we arrived at the staff room, Horikita called Chabashira-
sensei. Similarly, Ryuuen called Sakagami-sensei, who appeared first and
took the manila envelope from Ryuuen.
Moments later, Chabashira-sensei showed up and took Sakagami-
sensei’s place. She already seemed to know what we were there for, and her
gaze focused only on the manila envelope. She paid no attention to Ryuuen,
off to the side.
“These are the final questions, Chabashira-sensei,” said Horikita.
“I’ll hold on to them,” said Chabashira-sensei.
Ryuuen watched with a creepy smile. As Chabashira-sensei reached for
the envelope, Horikita paused.
“I’d like to ask you one thing, if I may,” Horikita said to Chabashira-
sensei.
“Yes?”
“These questions are linked to either Class D’s victory or defeat.
They’re two sides of the same coin. We must avoid a leak at all costs. After I
hand these papers over to you, could you please not show them to anyone
else? Myself included.”
“You want me to turn down absolutely anyone who asks to see them?”
Chabashira-sensei asked.
“Would that be a problem?”
“That’s not the issue. I understand that you’re afraid of information
leaking, and the school has no right to refuse your request. However, there
are conditions,” said Chabashira-sensei.
“Conditions, you say?”
“The entire class needs to agree to this. Has everyone approved this
measure?”
Page 170
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“I didn’t receive permission from every individual student, but…I
don’t think they’d object. No one wants their class to lose,” said Horikita.
“You can’t say that for sure. Some students might very well want to
lose,” said Chabashira-sensei.
“That’s—”
Chabashira-sensei continued. “On that note, can you guarantee that
these are the exam questions your class wishes to use? Not everyone in class
saw and agreed to all of them, right?”
“Are you asking me to prove that? You want me to show the questions
to everyone in class and confirm that they’re okay with them?”
“I’m saying that it’s not that simple. I can’t be entirely sure that you,
Horikita Suzune, are acting for your class’s sake. That said, I’ll honor your
request. If any student asks, I absolutely won’t disclose the questions and
answers you created,” said Chabashira-sensei.
“Thank you very much. Now I can face the exam in peace.”
“However, I will say this—generally, it’s not ideal to restrict
information in this manner. It proves that the class isn’t united,” said
Chabashira-sensei.
“A painful lesson to learn. I’ll work harder to bring the class together,”
answered Horikita confidently.
Chabashira-sensei smiled a bit. “You’ve changed, Horikita.”
“Some things can’t stay the same.”
“As I said, I’ll honor your request. In case of unforeseen
circumstances, though, I’d like to add one provision to our arrangement. As
long as they have your permission, Horikita, I’ll disclose information to those
asking to see the questions. Is that okay?” asked Chabashira-sensei.
“Yes, as long as I’m present at the time,” said Horikita.
“Of course. Someone might lie about having your permission, after all.
In the event that someone comes looking for the questions, well, I’ll tell them
everything you said. As a teacher, I can’t lie,” said Chabashira-sensei.
Horikita breathed a sigh of relief. Something had finally gone right.
This plan was foolproof, and should’ve precluded the possibility of
Page 171
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
underhanded tricks like the kind we saw in the sports festival. Even if
someone tried to pay to see the questions, it wouldn’t be allowed.
However, something still felt off to me.
Everything was going smoothly. The test questions that Horikita and
Hirata had devised were undoubtedly very difficult, and Horikita had put
preventative measures in place to ensure that they didn’t leak. Even if
Kushida tried to obtain the answers for Ryuuen, she’d need Horikita’s
presence and approval. Everything was rock solid. No holes anywhere.
Chabashira-sensei solemnly accepted the test questions and motioned
for us to leave. Still, Ryuuen’s resolute attitude felt off—something about the
fact that he didn’t seem flustered at all.
“Let’s head on back, Ayanokouji-kun. Our business here is finished.”
I ignored Horikita and looked into Chabashira-sensei’s eyes instead.
She stared at me in return.
See it, Horikita. Before it’s too late.
I couldn’t say anything in front of Ryuuen. Horikita started to walk
away, then immediately stopped dead in her tracks.
“Chabashira-sensei. You said that you wouldn’t lie, didn’t you?”
“That’s right. That’s required of me, as a teacher,” she replied.
“In that case, will the school accept the questions I just submitted to
you?”
Horikita had noticed. She’d figured it out herself.
“Not until we confirm that there isn’t anything abnormal about them,”
replied Chabashira-sensei.
“What’s the matter, Horikita?” I asked.
Horikita didn’t pay any attention to me. “Let me rephrase that. Have
you already accepted other test questions?”
Our teacher became quiet. “What do you mean by that?”
“I’d like to hear the answer from your own lips, Chabashira-sensei.”
“My response is that the school already accepted and finished
reviewing questions from Class D.”
Page 172
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Our reality imploded.
“So…does that mean someone else already submitted test questions
and answers?” asked Horikita. She couldn’t seem to process what was
happening.
“Correct. The school won’t use the questions you just handed me,” said
Chabashira-sensei.
“Please cancel acceptance of the previously submitted test questions. I
have the correct ones here,” said Horikita, pointing to the manila envelope.
“Unfortunately, Horikita, I already finished reviewing another
student’s questions. That student shared similar concerns. They wanted me to
keep the questions secret, too. This student said that, in the event that another
student selfishly showed up and asked to change the problems, I should
merely accept the new questions and hold on to them. They also wanted me
to tell them who asked to swap those questions afterward,” said Chabashira-
sensei.
“What in the world?” The fight drained out of Horikita, and she
slumped over. This was far too cruel. “What student? Please tell me.”
“Kushida Kikyou.”
The answer was obvious. Horikita had thought that she would prevent
Kushida’s betrayal. However, Kushida had struck first. Our knowledge of her
past made her take bold, drastic measures.
“But under the right circumstances, Class D can change the questions
the school already accepted, yes?”
“Yes. However, the deadline is the end of today. If you wish to change
the test questions, please bring Kushida here,” said Chabashira-sensei.
“That…”
It was hopeless. Kushida wouldn’t agree to that. Even if we started
looking for her now, there was a 100 percent chance that she’d turned her
phone off and holed up in her dorm room—or somewhere else, even.
“I can only speculate about which one of you is lying, Horikita. I don’t
know the truth. I also acknowledge that an unknown third party might be
pulling the strings here. If you don’t resolve this dispute within your class,
it’ll be bad,” said Chabashira-sensei.
Page 173
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“How much time do we have left to correct the questions?”
“Until 6 p.m.”
I checked my phone. It was a little before four. We only had about two
hours left.
“Ha ha ha ha ha! What are you even doing, Suzune?” Ryuuen sneered.
The guy had undoubtedly known about this situation from the very start; he
laughed raucously at our despair. “This is already checkmate, don’t you see?
The questions that you struggled so hard to come up with are completely
meaningless!”
“Were you behind this? Did you instruct Kushida-san to do this?”
asked Horikita.
“Hmm, who can say? I mean, it’s not like I know anything about Class
D, right?”
Horikita raised her voice. “I’m not going to tolerate this outsider
eavesdropping on the conversation any further!”
“Oh ho, how scary. Guess I’ll just head back to my dorm like a good
boy. I sure am looking forward to the exam’s results,” said Ryuuen.
“Aren’t you going to look for Kushida, Horikita?” Chabashira-sensei
asked.
“I dislike futile gestures.” Even if we did manage to find Kushida,
there was no way she’d comply. The game was already over. “Did Kushida-
san instruct you not to show the questions to anyone?”
“No, I received no such instructions,” said Chabashira-sensei.
“Please show them to me, then.”
Chabashira-sensei showed Horikita the test questions that Kushida
submitted. After only a brief glance, one thing became apparent.
“These are incredibly difficult,” Horikita said.
“Yeah. They definitely are,” I replied.
Kushida’s questions didn’t appear any easier than those Horikita and
Hirata had prepared. These were excellently constructed problems. In fact,
they were so well-structured that you’d never guess that Horikita herself
didn’t come up with them. Since Ryuuen was involved, chances were high
Page 174
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
that Kaneda made them.
If Kushida’s problems had been so easy that even Sudou could have
solved them, she would have been suspected of sabotage. These questions
made things much, much more complicated. If you knew the answers ahead
of time, it didn’t matter how difficult the problems were. As long as all of
Class C shared the answers with one another, they would get high scores.
Horikita had promised that she wouldn’t expose Kushida’s past. Hirata,
afraid of internal class conflict, probably wouldn’t say anything. That meant
that the student who struck first won the day. If Class D lost, Horikita, who’d
assumed leadership, would unavoidably take the blame. Kushida would
siphon away Horikita’s power while simultaneously using Ryuuen to drive
her into a corner.
None of this was as dire, however, as Horikita’s bet with Kushida. If
Kushida and Ryuuen had colluded, there was no doubt that Kushida received
Class C’s test questions in exchange for her cooperation. If that had
happened, Kushida would most likely score a perfect one hundred points on
her math exam. If Horikita answered even one question incorrectly, she
would have to drop out of school.
“So, is there nothing more to be done?” asked Horikita.
It looked as if she was out of options. This all came down to the
naivete of her plans. If it’d been me, then…
“It’s all right, Horikita. Ryuuen left,” said Chabashira-sensei to
Horikita, who still hung her head. What was going on? Chabashira-sensei
didn’t look shaken in the least.
“Sorry. I wanted to take extra precautions just in case, so I kept up the
act,” said Horikita, lifting her head. She didn’t look depressed at all.
Then, I understood.
“You knew this was coming?” I asked.
“Yes. I couldn’t allow myself to be defeated the same way I was at the
sports festival. When the final exam’s details were announced, I immediately
consulted Chabashira-sensei. I had two requests. One, that I alone submit
Class D’s usable test questions, and two, that Chabashira-sensei pretend to
accept any other questions submitted,” said Horikita.
Page 175
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
In other words, Horikita had tricked Kushida into thinking that her test
questions were accepted.
“Now that they definitely believe that Kushida’s test problems were
used, if any Class C students aren’t studying for the test, they may just fail,”
said Horikita. I would never have imagined that she’d devise such a
wonderful counterattack. I couldn’t even have come up with anything like
this myself. Ryuuen had to be completely unaware of the damage Horikita
was about to do.
Page 176
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Page 177
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“At any rate, this is a difficult situation,” said Chabashira-sensei, a rare
look of genuine concern on her face. “I’ve never had a request like this in all
the time I’ve managed Class D. I didn’t expect such caution and deception.
However, you won’t always take the day, Horikita. If there are traitors like
this among your classmates, you’re doomed to fail.”
Chabashira-sensei was right. Even Class A, currently divided between
Sakayanagi’s and Katsuragi’s factions, would never have done something
like this.
This meant we needed to be careful in dealing with Kushida.
“I understand. However, this ends with the final exam.” I felt
Horikita’s determination.
“Really? In that case, I look forward to it.”
Horikita sighed in relief as she watched Chabashira-sensei go back
inside with the manila envelope. Once the two of us were alone, she bowed
her head and apologized to me.
“Sorry for keeping quiet about this.”
“No, that’s all right. To be honest, I had no idea.” I’d underestimated
Horikita.
“Ryuuen’s knocked me down so many times now. I thought that it was
about time I learned,” said Horikita.
This had not only crushed Class C’s decisive victory, it had put Class
D a step in the lead. However, Horikita’s final challenge remained.
“All that’s left now is to beat Kushida-san’s exam score.”
Page 178
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
7.1
 
The first part of the final exam was here. The minimum overall score
each pair needed to pass was 692 points, which was lower than expected, but
we couldn’t afford to be careless. The first day covered four subjects: social
studies, English, Japanese, and mathematics. That meant that the outcome of
Horikita and Kushida’s battle would be revealed very soon.
As I walked into the hall on my way to the classroom, I met up with
Satou. For better or worse, she seemed to have been waiting for me.
“Good morning, Ayanokouji-kun. It’s almost time for the test, isn’t it?”
“Yeah. Did you sleep well last night?”
“I studied until about one o’clock. I feel a little nervous,” said Satou,
putting her hand to her chest and taking a deep breath.
“Well, I can’t say it’s going to be easy, but let’s do our best. You
should do well if you just apply everything you’ve learned,” I told her.
“Okay!”
No matter what, we were partners in this. I couldn’t deny our shared
destiny. If either of us failed, so did the other. Each of us could drag the other
into the abyss with them.
“Good morning, Satou-san.”
“Oh, good morning, Karuizawa-san.”
“Did you already have plans with Ayanokouji-kun? It’s rare to see the
two of you together,” said Karuizawa.
“N-no, we met up by chance.”
“Is that so? Well, how about we go get a drink at Pallet before class?”
asked Karuizawa.
“Okay. Well, see you later, Ayanokouji-kun,” said Satou, turning away
bashfully. Karuizawa looked at me for an instant before heading away.
“Those two are close, huh?” I muttered to myself.
Page 179
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“I think Karuizawa-san is a surprisingly jealous person,” Hirata said,
walking over.
“Huh?” I said.
“Good morning.”
“Good morning. What did you mean?”
“I’ve pretended to be Karuizawa-san’s boyfriend for a while now. I
noticed that she’s been paying more attention to you lately, Ayanokouji-kun.”
“I don’t think that’s right.” Karuizawa had been forced to remove
herself from Hirata and attach herself to me, kind of like a remora with a
shark.
“Really? Well, I’m glad. I don’t think it’s healthy to be in a fake
relationship. That’s probably selfish of me to say, though,” Hirata replied as
we made our way to the classroom. “Horikita-san’s questions will definitely
sting Class C. I don’t think it should be that difficult for Class D to win,
provided that everyone handles the exam well.”
Hirata overflowed with self-confidence. Despite one unforeseen
matchup, everything else had gone according to plan.
“To tell you the truth, there was something I wanted to talk to you
about, Ayanokouji-kun,” Hirata added. “Do you know Shiina Hiyori-san?”
“She’s in Class C. We met the other day when she showed up at
Keisei’s study group,” I replied.
“She came by my study group, too. It seems that Class C is looking for
the mastermind hiding in Horikita-san’s shadow.”
“Seems like it.”
“You’re the one pulling Horikita’s strings, Ayanokouji-kun,” said
Hirata. It wasn’t a question, just a statement of fact. “I wouldn’t tell anyone
else, of course. I’m sure that you have something planned. Besides, you’ve
saved Class D many times over.”
“I see. I’m grateful to hear you say that.”
“So, you don’t deny it?”
“Even if I did, you wouldn’t believe me.”

“I suppose I wouldn’t.”
“I’m not some kind of hero. I just don’t want to draw attention,” I told
him.
“I assume that you had a reason for what you did at the sports festival.
Still, are you okay? Class C is on the offense. If required, I’ve got your
back,” said Hirata.
Although I appreciated Hirata’s offer, it wasn’t necessary. “I’m good.
I’ll come to you if I need to, though.”
“I understand.”
We arrived at the classroom. I observed Sudou and the other guys from
a distance, noticing that they looked quite different from how they had during
previous exams. Instead of huddling and cramming in a panic, they calmly
used their time to review final details. Nearly half the students were seriously
concentrating on the material.
“Quite a difference, huh?” Hirata said.
“Definitely.” If you’d told me months ago that this was what Class D
would look like now, I wouldn’t have believed you.
Horikita was reading a book instead of studying. “Are you prepared?”
“You’re reading just before the test?” I asked. “What’re you reading?”
“And Then There Were None,” replied Horikita.
“Agatha Christie, huh? Well, let’s hope there’re more than ‘none’ left
when this is over,” I joked.
Horikita closed her book and shot down my dark humor. “Nobody is
leaving the school. It goes without saying that neither you nor I will
disappear, either.”
“The look on your face says that you’re going to win no matter what,”
I told her.
“Of course. That’s because I prepared to take first place in our grade
this time around,” she replied.
“If the questions Class C set turn out to be really simple, that’s going to
be tricky.”
Page 181
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Even so, I’ll win. That’ll only motivate me more,” she replied.
Well, now I really looked forward to this. Come on, Horikita. Show me
your stuff.

As the bell rang to signal that the test was going to begin, everyone
started to pack up their study materials. We had to store any and all objects
unnecessary for the exam in the lockers at the back of the classroom. The
only things we were allowed to have were writing utensils. If our pencils
broke, we ran out of lead, or we used our erasers up, we had to request
additional supplies from Chabashira-sensei.
“We will now start your final exam. Your first test subject is
contemporary Japanese. You are forbidden from turning your papers over
before I give you the signal to begin,” said Chabashira-sensei.
Rather than have the students at the front of each row pass the test
papers back, Chabashira-sensei placed the papers on each student’s desk
herself.
“The exam will be fifty minutes long. Please try to avoid leaving sick
or using the restroom. In the event that you aren’t able to wait, please raise
your hand and let me know. You won’t be allowed to leave the room during
the exam for any other reason,” she continued.
Chabashira-sensei finished handing out test papers. Not a single
student was talking by this point. Everyone focused on their papers. Shortly
afterward, the next bell rang, signaling the official start of the exam.
“Begin.”
We all flipped our test sheets over at the same time.
If everything went as Keisei had predicted, I thought the
countermeasures we’d developed should be enough. I quickly skimmed the
questions from start to finish, trying to judge whether my classmates could
solve them. It was a cruel lineup, but they weren’t impossible. We’d
predicted quite a few questions with near-pinpoint accuracy, so if we just
stayed calm, we had this. Keisei’s plans were right on the money.
Moreover, the school had altered several test questions significantly. I
could see traces of where Class C had attempted to trick us, but the school
had made edits.
Page 183
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
This test would be hardest for Class D’s most average students, like
Haruka and Akito. They needed to do the best they could and ace the
humanities like their lives depended on it.
Horikita, sitting next to me, immediately picked up her pen and
answered the first question. I twirled my pen in circles as I meditated on what
I should do. Satou had been relatively more enthusiastic than the other
students when it came to participating in the study sessions, and I anticipated
that she’d score higher than Ike or Yamauchi. However, I needed to
complement her score with an appropriate score of my own.
Considering what was to come in future, I decided to aim for a sixty-
point baseline. More than that, the important thing was that I wanted to see
how Kushida Kikyou reacted to the test.
I raised my head.
So far, Kushida appeared to be checking something as she scanned the
test sheet over and over. She stayed still for about two or three minutes.
Finally, she started answering questions.
The exam continued in tense silence.
There was a minor incident in the fourth period during the math
portion. That section, of course, would decide Horikita and Kushida’s
competition. The incident happened immediately after we flipped our exams
over.
“Why?” squeaked Kushida.
“What’s the matter, Kushida?” asked Chabashira-sensei.
“N-no, it’s nothing. I’m sorry,” she replied.
Kushida’s audible slipup must have concerned our classmates, but she
immediately started answering the questions regardless. Kushida, normally so
calm and composed, was in an agitated state we’d never seen before. She was
shaken.
Horikita continued working steadily, undistracted by Kushida’s unrest.
This was a true, fair battle now, powerful in its simplicity.
With my troubles rapidly fading, I concentrated on the exam.
Page 184

“Whew.” Horikita sighed and quickly glanced up at the classroom
ceiling.
“Looks like you’re all finished,” I said.
“I’ve never considered studying particularly stressful, but I studied
harder for this exam than ever before in my life,” she replied.
“What score would you say you got for the math portion?”
“A hundred. Or, at least, that’s what I’d like to say. Since there was
one part where the question seemed ambiguous, I can probably only say I got
ninety-eight points for certain. A few reasonably difficult questions were
mixed in.”
“It’s possible that you might’ve written something incorrectly or
missed an answer, though. Is there a chance that your score is any lower than
ninety-eight?” I asked.
“None. I’m certain that I overcame this test. I think I managed to get
near-perfect scores in the other three areas as well.”
“Well, that’s amazing.”
“I made this bet with Kushida-san assuming that she’d score a hundred
points. I was incredibly thorough in my preparations so I wouldn’t suffer
even a trivial mistake. Still, it’s a shame that I might’ve missed two points in
the end,” Horikita continued.
The questions Kaneda had set were by no means easy. I didn’t know
whether even someone like Keisei had managed to score above ninety. If
Horikita had truly gotten ninety-eight points or more, the top spot in our class
was hers. Despite tutoring so many students, she’d pushed through thanks to
her own willpower and 
spirit.
“Suzune, there’s something I want to tell you. Can I head back to the
dorm with you?” asked Sudou. He approached Horikita with his bag in hand,
looking somewhat drained.
Page 185
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“Something you want to tell me? Sorry, but can’t you just tell me
here?”
“About today’s test… I’m not sure if I hit the forty-point mark in every
subject. I wanted to apologize. I’m sorry,” said Sudou. He seemed sincere.
“That’s not terrible. Considering what was on the test, you did well,”
Horikita said. True, the exam had been more difficult than usual. “I have a
little something to take care of, so head on back with your friends.”
“You’re staying, Ayanokouji? Or are you two going back together?”
Sudou gave me a skeptical look.
“My business has nothing to do with him. I’m meeting Kushida-san. Is
there a problem?” asked Horikita.
“Kushida? Then no, none,” said Sudou. Once he knew Horikita was
meeting a girl, he didn’t care. “Well then, I’m gonna head back and study.”
“All right. But, considering what’s coming tomorrow, make sure to go
to bed early,” said Horikita.
“I know. Come on, Kanji, Haruki. Let’s go back,” said Sudou.
He didn’t sound perturbed in the least.
“By the way, what are your plans with Kushida?” I asked Horikita.
“It’s not a big deal. Since we can estimate our respective scores, I just
want to confirm something with her,” said Horikita.
It would be some time until we received our test results, but I was
convinced Horikita Suzune won. That was clear just from looking at Kushida,
who got up and quickly left the classroom.
“What’s the matter with her, I wonder?” said Horikita.
“She probably assumes that her score is lower than she expected, don’t
you think?”
“I hope so. Ryuuen can be rather tenacious.”
“Are you worried about him?” I asked.
“If he gave her the answers, she likely would’ve gotten a perfect score.
If that happened, then you and I would’ve had to drop out.”
“So, if that time came, would you have prostrated yourself before
Page 186
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Kushida and begged for forgiveness?” I asked.
“Was that sarcasm?”
“What?”
“Nothing, forget it.”
Horikita pursued Kushida. I decided to follow.
She walked into the hallway and called Kushida’s name. “Kushida-
san.”
Kushida slowly came to a stop. “What is it, Horikita-san?” she asked.
Fatigue and exhaustion were written on her face.
“Do you have a moment? I’d like to confirm something with you. But
there are people around, so how about we go somewhere else?” asked
Horikita.
“That depends on what you want to talk about,” said Kushida.
“Ayanokouji-kun will come along, since he’s involved in this matter.
You don’t mind, do you?” asked Horikita.
Kushida didn’t answer, but she didn’t refuse, either. She checked the
time on her phone and nodded. She had probably arranged to meet someone
else afterward.
Since there were still quite a few students left in the school, we decided
to head to the special building.
“You want to discuss our bet on the final exam. Right?”
“Yes. Though the results haven’t been announced yet, we should be
able to estimate our scores well enough ourselves,” said Horikita. “I’m
confident that I scored a ninety-eight or higher. What about you?”
Kushida didn’t look surprised to hear this. Rather, it was like she
already knew.
“We don’t have to wait for the official results,” muttered Kushida. “I
couldn’t have scored any higher than eighty. No, I probably didn’t even get
eighty. You won the bet, Horikita-san.”
“I see.” Horikita seemed slightly puzzled by Kushida’s low score. “I
thought you would have scored higher.”
Page 187
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“This is what I am,” said Kushida, sounding disappointed.
“I suppose it won’t be confirmed until the results are official, though.”
“There’s no need for that. You won the bet. Are you satisfied,
Horikita-san?”
“So, can I trust that you won’t get in my way from this point on?”
“I’ll keep my promise, no matter how much I hate it. Do you want that
in writing?”
“No need. Let’s just start by trusting each other,” said Horikita. She
held out her hand.
Kushida stared at Horikita’s outstretched hand, her eyes blank. “I hate
you, Horikita-san.”
“I know. But I think I can work hard to change that,” said Horikita.
“I feel like I’m growing to hate you more and more,” said Kushida.
She walked right past Horikita without taking her hand.
Page 188
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Page 189
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“I won’t do anything to impede you. But I’ll never cooperate with you.
Don’t forget that,” said Kushida.
“I see. That’s a shame,” said Horikita.
“Remember, Horikita-san, the terms of the bet were that I wouldn’t get
in your way. That’s all,” said Kushida. The darkness lingering in her eyes
seemed to latch on to me.
“That’s—”
Kushida left immediately. It was as if she didn’t want to face Horikita
for even one more second. She no longer had her sights on Horikita, but it
might be my turn next. There hadn’t been anything in the bet’s terms about
leaving me alone.
“I should’ve thought this through more carefully,” said Horikita.
Kushida wouldn’t keep her promise forever. Our presence destroyed
her hope for a peaceful future. The most I could expect for the time being was
a temporary ceasefire.

After Horikita headed back to the dorm, I thought about what was to
come. Ryuuen Kakeru wasn’t the type to leave unfinished business. Horikita
had certainly handled things well this time around, containing Ryuuen and
manipulating Kushida with a preemptive strike. In a healthy class, her
strategy probably wouldn’t have been very useful, but it was effective for
dealing with a traitor.
My phone vibrated.
What are you planning? the message read.
I wasn’t the only schemer here. You’re planning something too, aren’t
you, Ryuuen?
Another message showed up. I’m definitely going to make you pay.
An image file was attached to the last message. When I opened it, I
found a single photograph that spoke a thousand words.
“So, Manabe and her friends spilled the beans, huh?” I muttered.
Of course, I’d known that when I ran into Ryuuen and Hiyori. Ryuuen
had probably threatened the girls to reveal who might’ve seen them attack
Karuizawa, and now my name and Keisei’s name were running through his
mind. However, he had no evidence. That was why he was trying to corner
me. That was what he was thinking by sending me this photograph.
The fact that Ryuuen had the photo meant that he knew the
circumstances surrounding it. Depending how things played out, Ryuuen
would probably go after the person in the picture. If anything, this was a
declaration of war.
Did he enjoy the hunt that much? Enough. I was fed up with his
obsessive persistence.
I closed my phone and steeled myself. Half-measures wouldn’t do
here. If Ryuuen was dead serious about picking a fight, I’d return the favor in
kind.
“Come at me with everything you’ve got. I’ll play your game,” I said
Page 191
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
aloud.
Despite myself, I couldn’t help but feel a little excited.
Page 192
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
7.5
 
“You’re late, Kikyou. What, couldn’t slip past your classmates?”
asked Ryuuen.
“What are you plotting, Ryuuen-kun?” Kushida demanded. She drew
closer to Ryuuen on the isolated rooftop.
“Huh?” said Ryuuen.
“The questions and answers you gave me were completely different
than the ones on the exam.”
“Oh, yeah. I switched ’em out before the deadline. What about it?”
Ryuuen snorted derisively, then took a sip of bottled water.
“I told you, didn’t I? I will get Horikita expelled, no matter what. I
betrayed my classmates and switched out our questions on the condition that
you gave me the math test answers. If you kept your promise, Horikita
would’ve dropped out of school. But you betrayed me,” said Kushida.
“What? You mad about something so trivial?”
“Trivial? You want to win against Class D and give us nothing in
return?”
“You’re mistaken, Kikyou. Your questions weren’t used on the exam,”
replied Ryuuen.
“Huh? What are you even talking about? I turned them in right away,
just as you instructed me to. I even confirmed everything with Chabashira-
sensei.”
“You really haven’t noticed? Suzune acted ahead of time to stop the
school from formally accepting your questions. Thanks to that, not only did
we lose, we just barely avoided catastrophe. Everyone in my class depended
on that strategy,” said Ryuuen.
“Wait. Ahead of time? That’s… No way.”
“Go ahead and wait for the results if you doubt me. In all likelihood,
Class C lost to Class D. That rendered our agreement invalid. I’m not giving
Page 193
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
you the correct test questions if I get nothing in return,” said 
Ryuuen.
“Grrr!”
“How about showing me some gratitude instead?”
“Gratitude? I just lost to Horikita! What should I be grateful for?!”
Kushida recalled the humiliation she’d felt at admitting defeat in front of
Horikita. She was so enraged that she felt her blood boiling.
“So trusting, to get snared without even knowing it,” taunted Ryuuen.
Grabbing Kushida’s uniform, he forcefully unfastened a button on her blazer
and reached inside.
“Hey, what are you doing?!” shouted Kushida, backing away to put
some distance between herself and Ryuuen. Ryuuen smiled.
“Come on. I’m not doing anything. Go ahead, look in your pocket,” he
said.
“In my pocket?” Still on her guard, Kushida slowly reached into her
blazer. She felt paper, which she didn’t expect. “What is this?”
Ryuuen couldn’t have had enough time to put something in her pocket
just then. That meant he’d placed the paper there beforehand. When Kushida
unfolded it, she found a list of questions and answers for the math test.
However, they weren’t the questions that were actually on the exam in
the end. They were the ones Ryuuen had supposedly given her.
“Why were these in my uniform?”
“That’s probably not all there is. I assume that several pieces of
evidence of cheating are scattered throughout your belongings. I’m sure
you’ll see them if you go digging later,” said Ryuuen.
“I don’t understand,” said Kushida.
“Someone in Class D was prepared to go in for the kill. What if I had
still given you the right questions? Come on. Say you scored really high on
the exam and then someone accused you of cheating, and they found those
papers? What do you think would happen then?”
“Wait, you mean I’d be expelled?! Even though I didn’t cheat? That’s
stupid!” Kushida balked.
Page 194
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“If you were innocent, it would be stupid. But you got your hands on
the questions beforehand by working with me. There’d be nothing you could
do about it,” said Ryuuen.
Of course, Kushida could have claimed she was framed. Even if she
pulled through, however, it would’ve tainted her reputation. It wasn’t against
the rules for someone to offer their class’s questions to another class, but it
was considered disgraceful. That probably would’ve invalidated Kushida’s
test results and threatened her position in Class D, even if she avoided
expulsion. Class C would have been in grave danger, too.
“When did this cheat sheet get in my—?”
“You really don’t have any clue? Have you noticed any strange people
around?”
“No way, it can’t… No, wait. I went to our final test meeting at a
karaoke room last week with Horikita and the others. A girl got angry and
poured her juice on me. Afterward, she asked if she could take my blazer to
the cleaners. It was understandable, given that situation, but…for some
reason, it keeps nagging at me,” said Kushida.
“Let me guess who that girl was. Karuizawa Kei,” said Ryuuen.
“H-how did you know? Don’t tell me you saw?”
“How could I have seen? It’s simple deduction,” said Ryuuen. He
tapped his finger against the side of his head. “Explain what happened from
the beginning.”
Though Kushida felt disoriented, she told Ryuuen everything. She
explained that Horikita and Hirata had invited everyone, and that
Ayanokouji, Sudou, and Karuizawa all sat together. In the middle of their
meeting, Karuizawa started a fight and poured juice on her.
After quietly listening, Ryuuen took his deduction a step further. “No
doubt in my mind. Someone set a trap for you.”
“That’s not possible. It’s true that my blazer went to the cleaners, but I
checked my pockets when I got it back. Besides, the clerk would’ve told me
if there was something inside it!”
“That’s not what Karuizawa was going for. Did someone want to know
whether you had a spare uniform?”
Page 195
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“A spare? That’s impossible,” said Kushida.
“What makes you say that with such certainty?”
“Are you trying to say that everyone there set a trap for me, and I
couldn’t see right through it? I’m not an idiot. I observe everyone’s behavior.
If they were lying to me, I definitely would’ve noticed.”
“Well, you’re probably right about that. However, only one or two
people at most lied to you,” said Ryuuen.
“Huh? How would—”
“If someone there read the situation perfectly, then it’s likely that
person deceived you. Someone who could figure out everyone’s thought
processes, behavioral tics, and habits. Someone who guessed what kind of
remarks they’d make. Someone who could read all those things perfectly.
Someone who wrote the script, so that you’d act your part in their play,” said
Ryuuen.
Kushida denied it, but then thought back on what had happened. Hirata
was consistently a pacifist. He would worry about Kushida’s blazer being
stained, and would want to placate Karuizawa’s unreasonable anger. And,
because the meeting took place right before the test, he would definitely ask
how many blazers Kushida had.
“Once they learned that you had one blazer, the only thing left to do
was plant the cheat sheet on you during gym class. The real question is, who
came up with the idea? It wasn’t Suzune or Karuizawa. They aren’t the kind
of girls who could do something like that,” said Ryuuen.
“So, you’re saying I was tricked? By who?”
“Shortly before the test, a letter accusing Ichinose of doing something
illegal went out, right?”
“Yeah, the letter you tried to trap her with, Ryuuen. Why did you do
that?”
“It was part of the mastermind’s strategy,” said Ryuuen.
“Huh?”
“I wasn’t the one who sent that letter. The person from Class D who set
you up did it.”
Page 196
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
“I don’t understand.”
“Do you really think I’d put a letter accusing Ichinose of fraud in every
single first-year student’s mailbox and deliberately add my own name to it?
Well, putting my own personality aside, it was only natural that everyone
thought that I did it,” said Ryuuen.
“If it wasn’t you, then you should’ve just denied it.”
“Do you really think I would do that?”
“No.” Kushida understood immediately. Ryuuen tended to pursue
things that excited him. If someone sent out letters and put Ryuuen’s name on
them, Ryuuen would find it tantalizing. Furthermore, because he hadn’t heard
any rumors of Ichinose’s supposed fraudulent activities before, he’d be
tempted to learn more.
Then why had someone deliberately put down Ryuuen’s name as the
sender? Because an anonymous message had less credibility.
“But what was the letter’s point? To put you on your guard?” said
Kushida.
“Who knows? I’ve thought about it at length, but it’s still unclear. Did
the culprit simply want to know whether Ichinose had a lot of points? Or
maybe… No, that’s impossible. Couldn’t be something that stupid,” said
Ryuuen. Whatever he’d considered was just far too removed from reality.
Either way, the strategy had been well prepared and flawlessly
executed. Ryuuen’s interest in the person he called “X” had only increased.
“Hey, Kikyou. I don’t know anything about your past, and I’m not
interested. However, if you keep trying to get Horikita kicked out of school,
you’re going to disappear. Get it?”
“You’re in a dangerous position yourself, aren’t you? If Class C loses
collective points for this exam, isn’t that bad?”
“Yep. With this stroke of luck, your class probably has a chance of
being promoted to C,” said Ryuuen.
“How does it feel to be knocked down a peg by the ‘defectives’ in
Class D?”
“I feel like I don’t have a care in the world right now. Whether it’s
Page 197
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
Class A or D, we’re only scratching the surface of our battle,” said Ryuuen.
“What do you mean?”
Of course, Ryuuen couldn’t answer her. However, his objective hadn’t
changed one bit since he’d started at the school. While there had been
moments when he stumbled, his preparations to reach Class A were still
progressing smoothly.
“Do your absolute best,” said Ryuuen, turning and starting to walk
away.
“Wait—the cheat sheet! Something’s not right here!”
“Heh.”
“What’s this all about? Tell me, Ryuuen!”
“You noticed?”
“Why did someone in Class D have these test questions? Only you and
I should have them.”
“Because I gave them to X, I suppose,” said Ryuuen.
“So, you betrayed me?”
“No. It was a necessary deal.”
Ryuuen’s eyes lowered to his cell phone. On it were pictures of the
questions and answers before he’d changed them. He had sent those pictures
to an unidentified email address.
“However, X understands me very well,” he added.
He’d received a message from X with the word “Transaction” in the
subject line. The message read as follows: Provide me with the questions and
answers that Class C devised for our final exam, or make significant changes
to the questions you gave Kushida Kikyou.
Normally, Ryuuen wouldn’t dignify that with a response. However,
moments earlier, X had freely given him information beneficial to Class C
with no strings attached, by warning him that Horikita Suzune had seen
through Ryuuen’s plans and taken preemptive action to get her questions
approved instead of Kushida’s. That had come as quite the shock to Ryuuen,
whose whole strategy depended on the questions he thought Kushida had
submitted. Without X’s warning, the Class C students who didn’t study
Page 198
Goldenagato | mp4directs.com
enough might’ve failed.
Knowing that, Ryuuen had had three options.
The first was to defy X and give Kushida the correct questions for the
math test, letting her win her bet against Horikita. However, Ryuuen wanted
to avoid Horikita being expelled at all costs.
The second was to leave the test questions as they were and let
Kushida’s cheating be exposed, so she’d get kicked out of school. However,
Ryuuen didn’t want to give X exactly what he wanted. Playing into X’s ideal
scenario was no fun.
The final option, and the one Ryuuen eventually chose, was to give
Kushida the wrong questions and let Horikita win.
“So, X protected Suzune while managing to keep you in check,
Kikyou,” said Ryuuen. When he’d realized that X turned his strategy to use
Kushida against him, he’d barely held back his laughter. “But I’m about to
drive him into a corner. If he doesn’t reveal his identity—”
Ryuuen pulled up an image on his phone—the same image he’d sent
the mysterious mastermind. The person in the photograph would be
instrumental to discovering X’s identity.
“Then I’m going to destroy her.”

Syougo Kinugasa here. Lately, I’ve been pretty worried about an
epidermoid cyst on my body, which has grown to about the size of a golf ball.
Scary.
Next up, the seventh volume of Classroom of the Elite. The sixth
volume was a kind of calm before the storm, giving me a chance to explore
each character’s internal changes. The seventh volume will greatly advance
the story. It will include things like a look into Ayanokouji Kiyotaka’s past,
and a decisive battle with a certain enemy.
And then…yes, there will be an anime adaptation of Classroom. That’s
thanks to all of you, and you have my utmost gratitude. Tomoseshunsaku-
sama and I are both overjoyed, especially since we recently celebrated ten
years of (metaphorically) licking each other’s wounds. I’ll definitely have the
seventh volume out by the time the anime starts broadcasting! (I’ve never had
a confident declaration like that go well for me, but there’s a first time for
everything.)
Including the editors, publishers, anime producers, and everyone else, a
lot of people are involved with this project now, and I’ll do my absolute best
to ensure that their efforts aren’t wasted. Again, thank you. I’m looking
forward to working with you all.
